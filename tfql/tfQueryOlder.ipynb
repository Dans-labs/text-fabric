    "  A single walk over all nodes could construct these sets in one go, in a fraction\n",

    "  from the earlier obtained sets.\n",

    "How would that work, filtering along an edge in the graph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is an edge from node1 to node2 (in the query graph).\n",
    "This edge specifies a relationship between nodes in the result nodeset of n1 and nodes \n",
    "in the result nodeset of n2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In English: such an edge says: hey TF node in result set of n1: \n",
    "do you have a parent (or child, or older brother or younger sister)\n",
    "that occurs in the result of n2?\n",
    "\n",
    "If so: you can stay. If not: you're OUT.\n",
    "So this weeds out TF nodes from the result set of n1.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can also reduce the nodes in the result set of n2.\n",
    "Every TF node in the result set of n2 that does not figure as the parent\n",
    "(or child or brother/sister) of a TF node in the result set of n1 is also out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way we can take every edge, one by one, and perform the filtering.\n",
    "This is also a fast operation, provided we can make the elementary relationship checks\n",
    "quickly. (And we can, in TF, thanks to precomputing).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have done all edges, we probably have to iterate again over all edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because an edge between n2 and n3 could have weeded out additional TF nodes from the \n",
    "result set of n2, and this influences the validity of the TF nodes in the result set of n1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably we have to repeat until the result sets do not change anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or we can find a way to order the edges, so that we can do them in one or two passes.\n",

    "### Query graph\n",
    "A query is a graph of query nodes and query edges.\n",
    "We refer to the query nodes as\n",
    "$$q_1, ... , q_n$$\n",
    "and to the query edges as\n",
    "$$e_1, ... , e_k$$\n",
    "where every\n",
    "$$e_j = (R_j, q_f, q_t)$$\n",
    "for some $f$ and $t$ in $1, ..., n$, \n",
    "where $R_j$ is a relationship between text nodes.\n",
    "That means, if $s$ and $u$ are text nodes, $sR_ju$ is either *true* or *false*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query node\n",
    "A query node $q_i$ consists of an\n",
    "[otype](https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/otype)\n",
    "of text nodes and a \n",
    "[features](https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/0_overview.html)\n",
    "dict.\n",
    "The features dict specifies any number of data features, with an allowed value or set of allowed values for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wool and yarn\n",
    "The set of all text nodes of an\n",
    "[otype](https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/otype)\n",
    "is called the *wool* of that otype.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wool of a query node, is the wool of the otype that is associated with that query\n",
    "node.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we filter the wool of a node by some process, we call the result set a *yarn*\n",
    "of that query node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *principal* yarn of a query node consists of the wool of the query node,\n",
    "filtered by the features dict of the query node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spinning and proper yarns\n",
    "If we have an edge $e_j = (R_j, q_f, q_t)$ and if we have yarns $y_f, y_t$ for\n",
    "$q_f, $q_t, then we *turn* the edge $e_j$ \n",
    "to *spin* the yarns $y_f$, $y_t$ further.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this spinning are two new yarns, $z_f, z_t$, obtained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we iterate through the text nodes $s$ in yarn $y_i$:\n",
    "  * we compute the set of text nodes $u$ in $y_j$ such that $sRu$ holds;\n",
    "  * if this set is non-empty, we:\n",
    "    * add those $u$ text nodes to $z_j$\n",
    "    * add the $s$ text node to $z_i$\n",
    "  Otherwise we do not add nodes to $z_i$ nor to $z_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So spinning means thinning out the yarns of two query nodes that are connected to a\n",
    "query edge, in such a way, that afterwards the relationship that is associated\n",
    "with the edge, can be realized for every text node in both yarns.\n",
    "In other words: after spinning, every text node in a yarn involved, has at least one\n",
    "counterpart text node in the other yarn such that both are in relationship which each other.\n",
    "That is, the relationship belonging to the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, every *spinning* action is caused by a *turn* of the edge, which acts as the spinning\n",
    "wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *proper yarn* of a query node is either its *principal yarn* or any yarn that can be spun \n",
    "from an other proper yarn.\n",
    "So if we start with the principal yarn of a query node, and start spinning, we produce\n",
    "proper yarns for that query node.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If this is the case, we call text node $s_i$ a *stitch* for query node $q_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A result can be seen as a stitching together of the principal yarns of the query nodes,\n",
    "in such a way, that all constraints specified by the query edges are satisfied.\n",
    "The stitches are those nodes in the text, one for each yarn, that together constitute\n",
    "a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overspun and underspun yards\n",
    "\n",
    "If a yarn of a query node has become so thin, that it fails to contain stitches of\n",

    "we call the yarn *overspun*.\n",

    "**Under every *thorough* strategy, the iteration always terminates.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If an edge is turned, no yarn becomes longer. It is possible, however, that no yarn\n",

    "\n",
    "For every turn of an edge there are two cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. No yarn becomes shorter:\n",

    "   This is so, because the recently turned edge becomes up-to-date, and no other edges    \n",

    "b. One or more yarns become shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose that that the sequence of edge turnings never stops.\n",

    "Our infinite turning is then an infinite sequence of `a`s and `b`s.\n",

    "In that sequence there cannot be infinitely many `b`s, because every `b` corresponds to\n",
    "a shortening of the total amount of yarn, and the total length of yarn is finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there must be infinitely many `a`s.\n",
    "That means that from some point onwards, we see only `a`s and never a `b` anymore.\n",
    "But every `a` decreases the number of non-up-to-date edges, so a sequence of `a`s is\n",

    "That means that $u$ belongs to every yarn of $q_t$ that is not overspun.\n",

    "\n",
    "By following the definition of turning an edge,\n",

    "**Proof:**\n",
    "Because the yarns are never overspun by lemma 2,\n",
    "we must prove that when all edges are up-to-date,\n",
    "none of the yarns are *underspun*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are in the situation that all edges are up-to-date.\n",
    "Suppose that in this situation there is an underspun yarn $y_i$, associated\n",
    "with query node $q_i$.\n",
    "That means that $y_i$ contains a text node $s$ that does not belong to any final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us have a closer look at how $q_i$ lies hooked up in the query graph.\n",
    "Because the query is a connected component, we have only these possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case a: $q_i$ does not belong to an edge.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $q_i$ must the only node, because if there were other nodes,\n",
    "there would have been bridges from $q_i$ to those other nodes, and hence\n",
    "$q_i$ would be involved in edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the query is just one node without edges, hence $y_i$ is the primary yarn,\n",
    "and hence all nodes in it are results. So this $s$ cannot exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case b: $q_i$ has an out-going edge or an incoming edge.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For all $q_i$-outgoing edges $(R_j, q_i, q_t)$ it holds that there\n",
    "is a $u$ in the yarn $y_t$ of $q_t$ such that $sR_ju$.\n",
    "This is because all edges are up-to-date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like wise, for all $q_i$-incoming edges $(R_k, q_f, q_i)$ it holds that\n",
    "there is a $u$ in the yarn $y_f$ of $q_f$ such that $uR_ks$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all $u$s found in this way belonged to the result, then $s$ would also belong\n",
    "to the result, because all its edge constraints would be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if, as we assumed, $s$ is not in the result, then at least one of those $u$s\n",
    "does not belong to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can repeat the same argument for this $u$, and find a $v$ that does not belong\n",
    "to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are finitely many nodes, we find a cycle $s_1, ... , s_k$ of text\n",

    "## Result fetching\n",
    "\n",
    "Spinning is just part of the solution.\n",
    "It thins out the space in which solutions exist, and does a better job for graphs without\n",

    "\n",
    "But after spinning, we have to find the valid stitches between the yarns.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a separate search process. \n",
    "The challenge is to wade through all possibilities in an efficient way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For graphs without cycles we know that if we start with any text node in any yarn, it will\n",
    "be part of a result.\n",
    "And if we start stitching that node to a node in the next yarn, we are sure that the\n",
    "pair is also part of a result. And so on. So in this case we can stitch arbitrarily (note\n",
    "that stitching implies that we hop from one yarn to the other by following the appropriate\n",
    "relationships between text nodes), and always generate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it does not matter much in what order we stitch, because we need to make all stitchings anyway to generate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the graph does have cycles, then we will discover that certain partial stitichings will\n",
    "lead to no valid results.\n",
    "Because of that strategy becomes important, because if we are not smart, we could spend a lot\n",
    "of time in rejecting millions of stitchings, before arriving at the first valid stitiching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example, and let us become a bit more concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose our graph has nodes: *Sentence*, *Word1*, *Word2*, all without feature restrictions.\n",
    "So the primary yarns are all sentences, all words, all words, respectively.\n",
    "Suppose we have 100,000 sentences, all 10 words, so 1 million words in total.\n",

    "in sentence $s$, $w_2$ is a word in the same sentence $s$, and $w_1$ comes before $w_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start stitching by first picking word1, then word2, then sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start to pick the first word $w_1$ in the yarn of word1, which is all words>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we pick a word $w_2$ in the yarn of word2, such that $w_2$ comes after $w_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have 999,999 possibilities for $w_2$, of which only the first 10 are part of\n",
    "a result. All others are not in the same sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we try out all these $w_2$s, we get 10 results fairly quickly, and then 999,990 spurious tries, before we try a new node in the yarn of *Word1* and get new results.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time we have collected all results,\n",
    "we have visited a million times on average half a million words, or\n",
    "$1,000,000 \\times 500,000 = 500,000,000,000$ words.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have done it in an other way: after picking $w_1$ from the yarn of *Word1*,\n",
    "we pick a sentence $s_1$ from the yarn of *Sentence* (only one possibility), and from\n",
    "there we pick a $w_2$ from the yarn of *Word2* such that $w_2$ is in $s_1$ (only 10 possibilities). Of those 10 possibilities, one will be rejected, (where $w_2 = w_1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we move to the next $w_1$ in the yarn of $Word1$, which is the second word in the same sentence, pick the same $s_1$ in the sentence yarn, pick the same words in the *Word2*\n",
    "yarn, reject 2 of them, and deliver 8 results.\n",
    "And so on.\n",
    "When we have gone through the whole of $s_1$, we have tried 100 words, and rejected 50 of them. \n",
    "And so it goes for all sentences.\n",
    "In the end we find all 100,000 * 50 = 5,000,000 solutions by visiting 10,000,000 words.\n",
    "\n",
