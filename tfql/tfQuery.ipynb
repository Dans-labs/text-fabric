    "* if we work within the strongest filtering query nodes, we do not have to do much work and when we reach the\n",
    "  weaker filters, they will decrease rapidly\n",
    "* so we postpone to touch the bigger sets as long as possible, and when we touch them, they are expected to decrease\n",

    "### Query graph\n",
    "A query is a graph of query nodes and query edges.\n",
    "We refer to the query nodes as\n",
    "$$q_1, ... , q_n$$\n",
    "and to the query edges as\n",
    "$$e_1, ... , e_k$$\n",

    "That means, if $s$ and $u$ are text nodes, $sR_ju$ is either *true* or *false*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query node\n",
    "A query node $q_i$ consists of an\n",
    "[otype](https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/otype)\n",
    "of text nodes and a \n",
    "[features](https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/0_overview.html)\n",
    "dict.\n",
    "The features dict specifies any number of data features, with an allowed value or set of allowed values for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wool and yarn\n",
    "The set of all text nodes of an\n",
    "[otype](https://etcbc.github.io/text-fabric-data/features/hebrew/etcbc4c/otype)\n",
    "is called the *wool* of that otype.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wool of a query node, is the wool of the otype that is associated with that query\n",
    "node.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we filter the wool of a node by some process, we call the result set a *yarn*\n",
    "of that query node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *principal* yarn of a query node consists of the wool of the query node,\n",
    "filtered by the features dict of the query node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spinning and proper yarns\n",
    "If we have an edge $e_j = (R_j, q_f, q_t)$ and if we have yarns $y_f, y_t$ for\n",
    "$q_f, $q_t, then we *turn* the edge $e_j$ \n",
    "to *spin* the yarns $y_f$, $y_t$ further.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this spinning are two new yarns, $z_f, z_t$, obtained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we iterate through the text nodes $s$ in yarn $y_i$:\n",
    "  * we compute the set of text nodes $u$ in $y_j$ such that $sRu$ holds;\n",
    "  * if this set is non-empty, we:\n",
    "    * add those $u$ text nodes to $z_j$\n",
    "    * add the $s$ text node to $z_i$\n",
    "  Otherwise we do not add nodes to $z_i$ nor to $z_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So spinning means thinning out the yarns of two query nodes that are connected to a\n",
    "query edge, in such a way, that afterwards the relationship that is associated\n",
    "with the edge, can be realized for every text node in both yarns.\n",
    "In other words: after spinning, every text node in a yarn involved, has at least one\n",
    "counterpart text node in the other yarn such that both are in relationship which each other.\n",
    "That is, the relationship belonging to the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, every *spinning* action is caused by a *turn* of the edge, which acts as the spinning\n",
    "wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *proper yarn* of a query node is either its *principal yarn* or any yarn that can be spun \n",
    "from an other proper yarn.\n",
    "So if we start with the principal yarn of a query node, and start spinning, we produce\n",
    "proper yarns for that query node.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If this is the case, we call text node $s_i$ a *stitch* for query node $q_i$. \n",

    "A result can be seen as a stitching together of the principal yarns of the query nodes,\n",
    "in such a way, that all constraints specified by the query edges are satisfied.\n",
    "The stitches are those nodes in the text, one for each yarn, that together constitute\n",
    "a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overspun and underspun yards\n",
    "\n",
    "If a yarn of a query node has become so thin, that it fails to contain stitches of\n",

    "Consider the relationships by which we hop from one yarn to another, while stitching.\n",
    "Some of them are functional, in the sense that coming from node, they leave only one possibility for the next node in the stitching.\n",

    "Take for example the relation: *sentence of*. Coming from a word, this relationship leaves\n",
    "us but one choice: the one sentence of which that word is a part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other relationships are virtually the opposite of functional: they leave very many options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example the relation: *comes after* between words. For any word you have on average the choice of half the total amount of words.\n",
