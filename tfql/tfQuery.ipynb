    "This edge specifies a relationship between nodes in the result nodeset of n1 and nodes \n",
    "in the result nodeset of n2.\n",
    "\n",
    "In English: such an edge says: hey TF node in result set of n1: \n",
    "do you have a parent (or child, or older brother or younger sister)\n",

    "\n",
    "If so: you can stay. If not: you're OUT.\n",
    "So this weeds out TF nodes from the result set of n1.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can also reduce the nodes in the result set of n2.\n",
    "Every TF node in the result set of n2 that does not figure as the parent\n",
    "(or child or brother/sister) of a TF node in the result set of n1 is also out.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way we can take every edge, one by one, and perform the filtering.\n",
    "This is also a fast operation, provided we can make the elementary relationship checks\n",
    "quickly. (And we can, in TF, thanks to precomputing).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have done all edges, we probably have to iterate again over all edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because an edge between n2 and n3 could have weeded out additional TF nodes from the \n",
    "result set of n2, and this influences the validity of the TF nodes in the result set of n1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably we have to repeat until the result sets do not change anymore.\n",
