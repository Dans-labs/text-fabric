# Combining data

This package contains functions to operate on TF datasets as a whole

There are the following basic operations:

* Modify, see `tf.compose.modify`,
  (add/merge/delete types and features to/from a single data source)
* Combine, see `tf.compose.combine`, (combine several data sources into one)
