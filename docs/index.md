# Text-Fabric

A corpus of ancient texts and linguistic annotations represents a large body of knowledge.
Text-Fabric makes that knowledge accessible to programmers and non-programmers.

Text-Fabric is:

* a [browser](Use/Browser.md) for text corpora;
* a [search engine](Use/Search.md) by means of templates;
* a Python3 package offering an [API](Api/App.md) for processing corpora;
* a data model and file format for corpora as [annotated graphs](Model/Data-Model.md)

## Acknowledgements

Text-Fabric is a matter of putting a few good ideas by others into practice.

While I wrote most of the code,
a product like Text-Fabric is unthinkable without the contributions
of avid users that take the trouble to give feedback and file issues,
and have the zeal and stamina to hold on
when things are frustrating and bugs overwhelming,
and give encouragement when they are happy.
