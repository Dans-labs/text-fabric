## Apps

Text-Fabric is a generic engine to process text corpora with sets of annotations.

But for some corpora, additional functionality is available in the form of *apps*.

See [Corpora](../About/Corpora.md).

## Text-Fabric browser

App-supported corpora can be explored in a browser interface.
No programming needed, but you will have to familiarize yourself with search templates.

See [Browser](Browser.md)

## Search templates

Text-Fabric has a powerful yet intuitive search engine that works with templates.

Read [Search](Search.md) to learn everything about it.

## Text-Fabric API

Explore your corpus by means of programming.

Start with the [App API](../Api/App.md) for corpora
that have been added to Text-Fabric as *apps*.

And then dive into the generic [TF API](../Api/General.md).
