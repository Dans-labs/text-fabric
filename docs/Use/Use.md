## Apps

Text-Fabric is a generic engine to process text corpora with sets of annotations.

But for some corpora, additional functionality is available in the form of *apps*.

See [Corpora](../About/Corpora.md).

## Text-Fabric browser

Corpora for which apps have been written can be explored without programming in a
browser interface.

See [Browser](Browser.md)

## Search templates

Text-Fabric has a powerful yet intuitive search engine that works with templates.
Read [Search](Search.md) to learn everything about it.

## Text-Fabric API

Explore your corpus by means of programming.
Start with [Apps](../Api/App.md) for corpora that have been added to Text-Fabric as *apps*
or dive into the [generic TF machinery](../Api/General.md).
