# Web site

TF contains a web-server (based on [bottle](http://bottlepy.org),
in which you can enter a search template and it will show you the results.

See the code in
[tf.server.web](https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric/tree/master/tf/server/web.py)
and
[tf.server.data](https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric/tree/master/tf/server/data.py)
to get started.
