And after it, if you want to cite it, use this DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.592193 .  Intro Text-Fabric is several things: a  browser  for ancient text corpora a Python3 package for processing ancient corpora A corpus of ancient texts and linguistic annotations represents a large body of knowledge.\nText-Fabric makes that knowledge accessible to non-programmers by means of \nbuilt-in a search interface that runs in your browser. From there the step to program your own analytics is not so big anymore. You can export \nyour results to Excel and work with them from there. And if that is not enough,\nyou can call the Text-Fabric API from your Python programs.\nThis works really well in Jupyter notebooks. Factory Text-Fabric can be and has been used to construct websites,\nfor example  SHEBANQ .\nIn the case of SHEBANQ, data has been converted to mysql databases.\nHowever, with the built-in  TF kernel , it is also possible to\nhave one process serve multiple connections and requests. Code statistics For a feel of the size of this project, in terms of lines of code,\nsee  Code lines Design principles There are a number of things that set Text-Fabric apart from most other ways to encode \ncorpora. Minimalistic model Text-Fabric is based on a minimalistic data model for text plus annotations. A defining characteristic is that Text-Fabric does not make use of XML or JSON,\nbut stores text as a bunch of features in plain text files. These features are interpreted against a  graph  of nodes and edges, which make up the\nabstract fabric of the text. Performance matters Based on this model, Text-Fabric offers a  processing API \nto search, navigate and process text and its annotations.\nA lot of care has been taken to make this API work as fast as possible.\nEfficiency in data processing has been a design criterion from the start. See e.g. the comparisons between the Text-Fabric way of serializing (pickle + gzip)\nand avro , joblib , and marshal . Search for patterns The  search API \nworks with search templates that define relational patterns\nwhich will be instantiated by nodes and edges of the fabric. Pick and choose data Students can selectively load \nthe feature data they need.\nWhen the time comes to share the fruits of their thought,\nthey can do so in various ways: when using the TF browser, results can be  exported  as PDF and stored\n  in a repository; when programming in a notebook, these notebooks can easily be shared online\n  by using GitHub of NBViewer. Contributing data Researchers can easily produce new data modules \nof text-fabric data out of their findings. Author and co-creation Text-Fabric is not so much an original idea as well putting a few good ideas by others\ninto practice.\nThe idea for the Text-Fabric data model ultimately derives from ideas floating\nin the ETCBC-avant-la-lettre 30 years ago, culminating in  Crist-Jan Doedens's Ph.D. thesis .\nThe fact that Ulrik Sandborg Petersen has made these ideas practical in his Emdros database system  15 years ago was the next crucial step. But time moves on, and nowhere is that felt as keenly as in computing science.\nProgramming has become easier, humanists become better programmers, and personal computers have become powerful\nenough to do a sizable amount of data science on them. That leads to exciting  tipping points : In sociology, a tipping point is a point in time when a group - or\n  a large number of group members \u2014 rapidly and dramatically changes\n  its behavior by widely adopting a previously rare practice. WikiPedia Text-Fabric is an attempt to tip the scales  by providing digital humanists with the\nfunctions they need  now , based on technology that appeals  now . Hence, my implementation of Text-Fabric search has been done from the ground up,\nand uses a strategy that is very different from Ulrik's MQL search engine.

It works much like the BHSA, but there is one big difference: the current Peshitta data\n  does not have linguistic annotations. There are just books, chapters, verses and words.\n  We expect to add lemmatizations of words shortly.\n  After this upgrade you can browse the peshitta by saying \ntext-fabric peshitta\n on the command line.\n\n\nFixed a bug in exportMQL:\n  when there are no enumerated values, do not write out an empty\n  \nCREATE ENUMERATION\n statement to the MQL file. \n\n\n\n\n6.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-12\n\n\n\n\nMore precise provenance data when you export results from the Text-Fabric data;\n\n\nUnder the hood reorganization of configuration data of apps like Bhsa and Cunei;\n\n\nApp-specific parts of the code have moved to more generic parts: a big cleanup has performed;\n\n\nThis will make it easier to add new apps.\n\n\n\n\n6.0.7-8-9\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-11\n\n\n\n\nAvoid computing the notebook name when the user passes a name for the notebook to \nCunei()\n or \nBhsa()\n.\n  And when the computing needs to be done, all exceptions will be caught, because the code for determining\n  the notebook name is brittle, and may crash if the Jupyter version does not match.\n\n\nFixed the bug that the Bhsa and Cunei did not run properly outside a notebook or outside a github repo.\n\n\nIn Bhsa and Cunei, the generated info after the incantation can be collapsed (features, API members).\n\n\n\n\n6.0.6\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-10\n\n\nIn the BHSA, the edge features are now shown too after the incantation.\n\n\nIf you hoist the API members into your namespace, you will get a list of hoisted names,\nlinked to the API documentation.\n\n\n6.0.5\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-09\n\n\nWhen using BHSA and Cunei in a notebook, there is an even simpler incantation which auto downloads features.\n\n\nIn the BHSA it is shown which features are loaded, with direct links to the feature docs.\n\n\n6.0.4\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-09\n\n\nWhen using BHSA and Cunei in a notebook, there is a simpler incantation which auto downloads features.\n\n\nSome issues concerning paths in zipfiles of downloaded data have been solved.\n\n\n6.0.3\n\u00b6\n\n\nEasier incantations for \nBhsa()\n and \nCunei()\n.\n\n\n\n\nIt is no longer needed to pass the name of the notebook, but you can still do so: \nname='mynotebook'\n\n\nYou can leave out the \napi\n argument in \nBhsa()\n. Then you do not have to load features by means of \nTF.load()\n,\n  \nBhsa()\n will load a standard set of features, and if the BHSA data is missing, it will download them first.\n\n\n\n\nThe former ways of calling \nBhsa()\n and \nCunei()\n are still valid. Note that all arguments have become optional.\n\n\n2018-10-08\n\n\nThe Text-Fabric browser will always print a banner with its name and version.\nIf you pass it the argument --help or -h or --version or -v it will show the relevant information\nand stop executing.\n\n\n6.0.2\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-07\n\n\nThe Text-Fabric browser takes it data by default from \n~/text-fabric-data\n.\nIt will not check local github clones for data.\n\n\nBut if you pass the option \n-lgc\n, it will first check your local github clones.\n\n\nSo it you do nothing special, the TF browser always works with the auto-downloaded data.\n\n\n6.0.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-06\n\n\nNot only the core BHSA data will auto load, also the related PHONO and PARALLELS data.\nA new release has been made of the related data, and they are now in sync with the release of the core data.\n\n\nIf you use auto load already, you do not have to do anything.\n\n\nBut if you have the etcbc/phono and etcbc/parallels repos in your \n~/github\n folder, you should do \na \ngit pull origin master\n on those repos.\n\n\nN.B.\n: I am contemplating to have the Text-Fabric browser always use data from \n~/text-fabric-data\n and no longer\nfrom \n~/github/etcbc\n. Then the TF browser always controls its own data, and it will not occur that\nthe version of the TF browser is not compatible with the version of the TF data in your github repos, or that\nthe main data and the related data are out of synch.\n\n\nThe disadvantage is that if you have the github repos on your system, you get redundant data in \n~/text-fabric-data\n.\nHowever, there is only one version kept in \n~/text-fabric-data\n, so this is not much.\n\n\n6.0\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-05\n\n\nA big update with several changes:\n\n\nAPI change:\n\u00b6\n\n\nT.text()\n has got more behaviours.\n\n\nThis change was needed for the Text-Fabric browser, in order to represent \nlexemes\n in exported files.\n\n\n\n\nShowcase: BHSA dictionary\n\n\nHere is how you can collect the BHSA lexemes in an Excel sheet.\n\n\n\n\nabout.md\n\n\nRESULTSX.tsv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt might also be handy for the programmers amongst you.\nSee the updated \nAPI doc on T\n, expand the T.text() item.\n\n\nAuto update\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Text-Fabric browser checks if you are using the most recent release of the data.\n\n\nFont rendering\n\u00b6\n\n\nA font rendering issue in Safari 12 in macos Mojave prevented the use of Ezra SIL for Hebrew in notebooks.\nWe now work around this by relying on the distribution of Ezra SIL as webfont\nin the \nfont library\n.\n\n\nAdditional small fixes.\n\u00b6\n\n\nNot worth telling.\n\n\n\n\nupdate Text-Fabric\n\n\nTo update Text-Fabric itself to version 6.0, consult \nUpgrade\n.\nPerform this step first, because the new TF may download the new data for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData update needed\n\n\nIn order to work successfully with the new \nT.text()\n function, you need a newer release (1.4) of the BHSA \ndata\n.\n(In fact, only one line in one feature has changed (\notext.tf\n).\n\n\n\n\nHere is how you get the new data release:\n\n\nAutomatically\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf previously your Text-Fabric browser has automatically downloaded the data for you, it will detect the new release\nand download it automatically. You do not have to do anything, except increase your patience.\nThe download (24 MB) takes some time and after that Text-Fabric will precompute related data, which may take\na few minutes. This is a one-time-step after a data update.\n\n\nManually\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you have a clone of the BHSA repository, then go to that directory and say \ngit pull origin master\n.\nIf you get error messages, then you have local changes in your local BHSA repository that conflict with\nthe github version. Probably you have run the tutorials in place. Best thing to do is:\n\n\n\n\ncopy your BHSA tutorial directory to somehwere else;\n\n\nremove your local BHSA repository entirely;\n\n\ndecide whether you really want the whole repo back (nearly 4 GB).\n\n\n\n\nIf not: you're done, and TF will download automatically the data it needs.\n\n\nIf you still need it: move one directory up (into the \netcbc\n directory) and do \ngit clone https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa\n.\n\n\nIf you want to consult the tutorials, either:\n\n\n\n\nview them on \nnbviewer\n; or\n\n\nrun them in a directory outside the BHSA repo (where you have copied it a minute ago).\n\n\n\n\n5.6.4\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-04\n\n\nSolved a font-rendering issue on Safari 12 (Macos Mojave): locally installed fonts, such as Ezra SIL are not being\nhonored. So I linked to a stylesheet of the \nfontlibrary\n which has a webfont version of\nEzra SIL. That worked.\n\n\n5.6.3\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-04\n\n\nExported tab-separated files get extension \n.tsv\n instead of \n.csv\n, because then they render better in GitHub. \n\n\n5.6.2\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-04\n\n\nSmall optimization.\nMore docs about reading and writing Excel compatible CSV files with Hebrew characters in it.\n\n\n5.6.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-04\n\n\nBetter exporting from TF browser: a good RESULTSX.tsv with results, sensibly augmented with information, directly openable\nin Excel, even when non-latin unicode code characters are present .\nAll features that occur in the searchTemplate are drawn in into the RESULTSX.tsv, onto the nodes they filter.\n\n\nAn additonal feature filtering is now possible in searchTemplates: \nfeature*\n. \nThis acts as \"no additional constraint\", so it does not influence the result set.\nBut it will be picked up and used to add information into the RESULTSX.tsv.\n\n\n5.5.25\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-10-03\n\n\nThe Text-Fabric browser exports results as node lists and produces also a CONTEXT.tsv with all feature\nvalues for all nodes in the results.\nHowever, it does not contain full text representations of the nodes and it is also not possible to see in what verses\nthe nodes occur.\n\n\nThat has changed. The last column of CONTEXT.tsv contains the full text of a node.\nAnd there are three columns at the beginning that contain the references to the sections the node is in.\nFor the BHSA that is the book, chapter and verse.\n\n\n5.5.24\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-09-25\n\n\nBHSA app in Text-Fabric Browser: the book names on the verse pad should be the English book names.\nThat is now in the help texts, including a link to the list of English book names.\n\n\n5.5.23\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-09-21\n\n\nProblem in use of \nmsgCache\n in the search engine, which caused \nfetch()\n to fail in some cases.

a feature value contains a \n|\n then in an RE you have to enter \n\\|\n to match it.\nBut to have that work in a TF search, you needed to say \n\\\\\\|\n. \n\n\nOn the other hand, in the same case for \n.\n instead of \n|\n, you could just sat \n\\.\n\n\nIn the new situation you do not have to double escape in REs anymore.\nYou can just say \n\\|\n and \n\\.\n.\n\n\n4.4\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-06-06\n\n\nSearch API:\n\n\nS.search() accepts a new optional parameter: \nwithContext\n.\nIt triggers the output of context information for nodes in the result

like\n\n\n1\n  word vt!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich checks for words that do not have a value for feature \nvt\n.\n\n\nThe syntax for this has now changed to\n\n\n1\n  word vt#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnequal (#) in feature value conditions.\n\n\nNow you can say things like\n\n\n1\n  word vt#infa|infc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeaning that the value of feature is not one of \ninfa\n, \ninfc\n.\n\n\nSo, in addition to \n=\n we have \n#\n for \"not equal\".\n*   Quantifiers.\n\n\nYou can now use quantifiers in search. One of them is like \nNOTEXIST\n in MQL.\nSee the \ndocs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of minor fixes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-25\n\n\n\n\nSeveral improvements in the pretty display in Bhsa and Cunei APIs\n\n\n\n\nUnder the hood changes in \nS.search()\n to prepare for \nquantifiers\n in search templates.\n\n\n\n\nTokenisation of quantifiers already works\n\n\nSearches can now spawn auxiliary searches without polluting intermediate data\n\n\nThis has been done by promoting the \nS\n API to a factory of search engines.\n    By deafault, \nS\n creates and maintains a single factory, so to the user\n    it is the same \nS\n. But when it needs to run a query in the middle of processing another query\n    it can just spawn another search engine to do that, without interfering with the\n    original search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNB: the search tutorial for the Bhsa got too big. It has thoroughly been rewritten.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-23\n\n\nThe Search API has been extended:\n\n\n\n\nyou can use custom sets in your query templates\n\n\nyou can search in shallow mode: instead of full result tuples, you just get a set\n    of the top-level thing you mention in your template.\n\n\n\n\nThis functionality is a precursor for\n\nquantifiers in search templates\n\nbut is also a powerful addition to search in its own right.\n\n\n4.1.2\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-17\n\n\nBhsa and Cunei APIs:\n\n\n\n\ncustom highlight colours also work for condensed results.\n\n\nyou can pass the \nhighlights\n parameter also to \nshow\n and \nprettyTuple\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-16\n\n\nBhsa API: you can customize the features that are shown in pretty displays.\n\n\n4.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-16\n\n\nBhsa and Cunei APIs: you can customize the highlighting of search results:\n\n\n\n\ndifferent colours for different parts of the results\n\n\nyou can choose your colours freely from all that CSS has to offer.\n\n\n\n\nSee the updated search tutorials.\n\n\n4.0.3\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-11\n\n\nNo changes, just quirks in the update process to get a new version of TF out.\n\n\n4.0.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-11\n\n\nDocumentation updates.\n\n\n4.0.0\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-11\n\n\n\n\nAdditions to Search.\n    You can now include the values of edges in your search templates.\n\n\nF.\nfeature\n.freqList()\n accepts a new parameter: \nnodeTypes\n. It will restrict its results to nodes in\n    one of the types in \nnodeTypes\n. \n\n\nYou can now also do \nE.\nfeature\n.freqList()\n.\n    It will count the number of edges if the edge is declared to be without values, \n    or it will give a frequency list of the edges by value if the edge has values.\n    Like \nF.freqList\n, you can pass parameters to constrain the frequency list to certain node types.\n    You can constrain the node types from which the edges start (\nnodeTypesFrom\n) and where they arrive\n    (\nnodeTypesTo\n).\n\n\nNew documentation system based on \nMkDocs\n.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.12\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-02\n\n\nThe Cunei and Bhsa APIs show the version of Text-Fabric that is being called.\n\n\n3.4.11\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-05-01\n\n\nCunei\n\n\n\n\ncases are divided horizontally and vertically, alternating with their\n    nesting level;\n\n\ncases have a feature \ndepth\n now, indicating at which level of nesting they\n    are.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.8-9-10\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-04-30\n\n\nVarious small fixes, such as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBhsa: Lexeme links in pretty displays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCunei: Prevented spurious \n</div>\n in NbViewer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.7\n\u00b6\n\n\nCunei: Modified local image names\n\n\n3.4.6\n\u00b6\n\n\nSmall tweaks in search.\n\n\n3.4.5\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-04-28\n\n\nBhsa API:\n\n\n\n\nnew functions \nplain()\n and \ntable()\n for plainly representing nodes, tuples\n    and result lists, as opposed to the abundant representations by \npretty()\n and\n    \nshow()\n.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-04-27\n\n\nCunei API:\n\n\n\n\nnew functions \nplain()\n and \ntable()\n for plainly representing nodes, tuples\n    and result lists, as opposed to the abundant representations by \npretty()\n and\n    \nshow()\n.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-04-26\n\n\nBetter search documentation.\n\n\nCunei API: small fixes.\n\n\n3.4.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-04-25\n\n\nBhsa API:\n\n\n\n\nSearch/show: you can now show results condensed: i.e. a list of passages with\n    highlighted results is returned. This is how SHEBANQ represents the results of\n    a query. If you have two results in the same verse, with \ncondensed=True\n you\n    get one verse display with two highlights, with \ncondensed=False\n you get two\n    verse displays with one highlight each.\n\n\n\n\nCunei API:\n\n\n\n\nSearch/show: the \npretty\n, \nprettyTuple\n, \nshow\n functions of the Bhsa API\n    have bee translated to the Cunei API.

Also: the feature\n\nfullNumber\n on cases is now called \nnumber\n, and contains the full hierarchical\npart leading to a case. There is an extra feature \nterminal\n on lines and cases\nif they are not subdivided.\n\n\nChanges in Cunei and Bhsa api:\n\n\n\n\nfixed a bug that occurred when working outside a GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-04-18\n\n\nChange in the Cunei api. \ncasesByLevel()\n now takes an optional argument\n\nterminal\n instead of \nwithChildren\n, with opposite values.\n\n\nwithChildren=False\n is ambiguous: will it deliver only cases that have no\nchildren (intended), or will it deliver cases and their children (understood,\nbut not intended).\n\n\nterminal=True\n: delivers only cases that are terminal.\n\n\nterminal=False\n: delivers all cases at that level.\n\n\n3.3\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-04-14\n\n\nSmall fix in the bhsa api.\n\n\nBumped the version number because of the inclusion of corpus specific APIs.\n\n\n3.2.6\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-04-14\n\n\n\n\nText-Fabric now contains corpus specific extras:\n\n\nbhsa.py\n for the Hebrew Bible (BHSA)\n\n\ncunei.py\n for the Proto-Cuneiform corpus Uruk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nFabric(locations=locations, modules=modules)\n constructor now uses \n['']\n\n    as default value for modules. Now you can use the \nlocations\n parameter on its\n    own to specify the search paths for TF features, leaving the \nmodules\n\n    parameter undefined, if you wish.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-03-23\n\n\nEnhancement in search templates: you can now test for the presence of features.\nTill now, you could only test for one or more concrete values of features. So,\nin addition to things like\n\n\n1\nword number=plural tense=yiqtol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou can also say things like\n\n\n1\nword number=plural tense\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand it will give you words in the plural that have a tense.\n\n\n3.2.4\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-03-20\n\n\nThe short API names \nF\n, \nT\n, \nL\n etc. have been aliased to longer names:\n\nFeature\n, \nText\n, \nLocality\n, etc.\n\n\n3.2.2\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-02-27\n\n\nRemoved the sub module \ncunei.py\n. It is better to keep corpus dependent modules\nin outside the TF package.\n\n\n3.2.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-02-26\n\n\nAdded a sub module \ncunei.py\n, which contains methods to produce ATF\ntranscriptions for nodes of certain types.\n\n\n3.2\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-02-19\n\n\nAPI change\n Previously, the functions \nL.d()\n and \nL.u()\n took rank into\naccount. In the Hebrew Bible, that means that \nL.d(sentence)\n will not return a\nverse, even if the verse is contained in the sentence.\n\n\nThis might be handy for sentences and verses, but in general this behaviour\ncauses problems. It also disturbs the expectation that with these functions you\nget \nall\n embedders and embeddees.\n\n\nSo we have lifted this restriction. Still, the results of the \nL\n functions have\nan ordering that takes into account the levels of the returned nodes.\n\n\nEnhancement\n Previously, Text-Fabric determined the levels of node types\nautomatically, based on the average slot-size of nodes within the node types. So\nbooks get a lower level than chapters than verses than phrases, etc.\n\n\nHowever, working with cuneiform tablets revealed that containing node types may\nhave a smaller average size than contained node types. This happens when a\ncontainer type only contains small instances of the contained type and not the\nbigger ones.\n\n\nNow you can override the computation by text-fabric by means of a key-value in\nthe \notext\n feature. See the \napi\n.\n\n\n3.1.5\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-02-15\n\n\nFixed a small problem in \nsectionFromNode(n)\n when \nn\n is a node within a\nprimary section but outside secondary/tertiary sections.\n\n\n3.1.4\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-02-15\n\n\nSmall fix in the Text API. If your data set does not have language dependent\nfeatures, for section level 1 headings, such as \nbook@en\n, \nbook@sw\n, the Text\nAPI will not break, and the plain \nbook\n feature will be taken always.\n\n\nWe also reformatted all code with a PEP8 code formatter.\n\n\n3.1.3\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-01-29\n\n\nSmall adaptions in conversion from MQL to TF, it can now also convert the MQL\ncoming from CALAP dataset (Syriac).\n\n\n3.1.2\n\u00b6\n\n\n2018-01-27\n\n\nNothing changed, only the names of some variables and the text of some messages.\nThe terminology has been made more consistent with the fabric metaphor, in\nparticular, \ngrid\n has been replaced by \nwarp\n.\n\n\n3.1.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-21\n\n\nThe \nexportMQL()\n function now generates one single enumeration type that serves\nfor all enumeration features. That makes it possible to compare values of different\nenumeration features with each other, such as \nps\n and \nprs_ps\n.\n\n\n3.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-20\n\n\nThe \nexportMQL()\n function now generates enumeration types for features, if\ncertain conditions are fulfilled. That makes it possible to query those features\nwith the \nIN\n relationship of MQL, like \n[chapter book IN (Genesis, Exodus)]\n.\n\n\n3.0.8\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-07\n\n\nWhen reading edges with values, also the edges without a value are taken in.\n\n\n3.0.7\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-07\n\n\nEdges with edge values did not allow for the absence of values. Now they do.\n\n\n3.0.6\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-05\n\n\nA major tweak in the \nimportMQL()\n function so that it can\nhandle gaps in the monad sequence. The issue arose when converting MQL for\nversion 3 of the \nBHSA\n. In that version there\nare somewhat arbitrary gaps in the monad sequence between the books of the\nHebrew Bible. I transform a gapped sequence of monads into a continuous sequence\nof slots.\n\n\n3.0.5\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-05\n\n\nAnother little tweak in the \nimportMQL()\n function so that it\ncan handle more patterns in the MQL dump file. The issue arose when converting\nMQL for version 3 of the \nBHSA\n.\n\n\n3.0.4\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-04\n\n\nLittle tweak in the \nimportMQL()\n function so that it can handle\nmore patterns in the MQL dump file. The issue arose when converting MQL for\n\nextrabiblical\n material.\n\n\n3.0.2, 3.0.3\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-03\n\n\nNo changes, only an update of the package metadata, to reflect that Text-Fabric\nhas moved from \nETCBC\n to\n\nDans-labs\n.\n\n\n3.0.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-02\n\n\nBug fix in reading edge features with values.\n\n\n3.0.0\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-10-02\n\n\nMQL! You can now convert MQL data into a TF dataset:\n\nimportMQL()\n. We had already \nexportMQL()\n.\n\n\nThe consequence is that we can operate with much agility between the worlds of\nMQL and TF.\n\n\nWe can start with source data in MQL, convert it to TF, combine it with other TF\ndata sources, compute additional stuff and add it, and then finally export it as\nenriched MQL, so that the enriched data can be queried by MQL.\n\n\n2.3.15\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-09-29\n\n\nCompletion: TF defines the concept of\n\nedges\n that\ncarry a value. But so far we have not used them. It turned out that it was\nimpossible to let TF know that an edge carries values, when\n\nsaving\n data\nas a new feature. Now it is possible.\n\n\n2.3.14\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-09-29\n\n\nBug fix: it was not possible to get\n\nT.nodeFromSection(('2_Chronicles', 36, 23))\n, the last verse in the Bible.\n\n\nThis is the consequence of a bug in precomputing the sections\n\nsections\n. The\npreparation step used\n\n\n1\nrange\n(\nfirstVerse\n,\n \nlastVerse\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsomewhere, which should of course have been\n\n\n1\nrange\n(\nfirstVerse\n,\n \nlastVerse\n \n+\n \n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.13\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-09-28\n\n\nLoading TF was not completely silent if \nsilent=True\n was passed. Better now.\n\n\n2.3.12\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-09-18\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall fix in\n    \nTF.save()\n.\n    The spec says that the metadata under the empty key will be inserted into all\n    features, but in fact this did not happen. Instead it was used as a default\n    when some feature did not have metadata specified.\n\n\nFrom now on, that metadata will spread through all features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew API function \nexplore\n, to get a list of all known\n    features in a dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.11\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-09-18\n\n\n\n\nSmall fix in Search: the implementation of the relation operator \n||\n\n    (disjoint slot sets) was faulty. Repaired.\n\n\nThe\n    \nsearch tutorial\n\n    got an extra example: how to look for gaps. Gaps are not a primitive in the TF\n    search language. Yet the language turns out to be powerful enough to look for\n    gaps. This answers a question by Cody Kingham.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.10\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-08-24\n\n\nWhen defining text formats in the \notext.tf\n feature, you can now include\nnewlines and tabs in the formats. Enter them as \n\\n\n and \n\\t\n.\n\n\n2.3.9\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-07-24\n\n\nTF has a list of default locations to look for data sources: \n~/Downloads\n,\n\n~/github\n, etc. Now \n~/Dropbox\n has been added to that list.\n\n\n2.3.8\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-07-24\n\n\nThe section levels (book, chapter, verse) were supposed to be customizable\nthrough the \notext\n feature. But in\nfact, up till version 2.3.7 this did not work. From now on the names of the\nsection types and the features that name/number them, are given in the \notext\n\nfeature. It is still the case that exactly three levels must be specified,\notherwise it does not work.\n\n\n2.3.7\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-05-12\n\n\nFixes. Added an extra default location for looking for text-fabric-data sources,\nfor the benefit of running text-fabric within a shared notebook service.\n\n\n2.3.5, 2.3.6\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-03-01\n\n\nBug fix in Search. Spotted by Cody Kingham. Relational operators between atoms\nin the template got discarded after an outdent.\n\n\n2.3.4\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-02-12\n\n\nAlso the \nFabric()\n call can be made silent now.\n\n\n2.3.3\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-02-11\n\n\nImprovements:\n\n\n\n\nyou can load features more silently. See \nTF.load()\n;\n\n\nyou can search more silently. See \nS.study()\n;\n\n\nyou can search more concisely. See the new \nS.search()\n;\n\n\nwhen fetching results, the \namount\n parameter of\n    \nS.fetch()\n has been renamed to \nlimit\n;\n\n\nthe tutorial notebooks (see links on top) have been updated.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-02-03\n\n\nBug fix: the results of \nF.feature.s()\n, \nE.feature.f()\n, and \nE.features.t()\n\nare now all tuples. They were a mixture of tuples and lists.\n\n\n2.3.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-01-23\n\n\nBug fix: when searching simple queries with only one query node, the result\nnodes were delivered as integers, instead of 1-tuples of integers.\n\n\n2.3\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-01-13\n\n\nWe start archiving releases of Text-Fabric at \nZenodo\n.\n\n\n2.2.1\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-01-09\n\n\nSmall fixes.\n\n\n2.2.0\n\u00b6\n\n\n2017-01-06\n\n\nNew: sortKey\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe API has a new member: \nsortKey\n\n\nNew relationships in templates: \nnearness\n.

Put your laptop on your lap, update\nText-Fabric, and start playing with search. Your laptop will spin itself warm\nwith your queries!\n\n\nText-Fabric just got a powerful search facility, based on (graph)-templates.\n\n\nIt is still very fresh, and more experimentation will be needed. Feedback is\nwelcome.\n\n\nStart with the\n\ntutorial\n.\n\n\nThe implementation of this search engine can be nicely explained with a textile\nmetaphor: spinning wool into yarn and then stitching the yarns together.\n\n\nThat will be explained further in a document that I'll love to write during\nXmas.\n\n\n1.2.7\n\u00b6\n\n\n2016-12-14\n\n\nNew\n\u00b6\n\n\nF.otype.sInterval()\n\n\n1.2.6\n\u00b6\n\n\n2016-12-14\n\n\nbug fix\n\u00b6\n\n\nThere was an error in computing the order of nodes. One of the consequences was\nthat objects that occupy the same slots were not ordered properly. And that had\nas consequence that you could not go up from words in one-word phrases to their\ncontaining phrase.\n\n\nIt has been remedied.\n\n\nNote\nYour computed data needs to be refreshed. This can be done by calling a new\nfunction \nTF.clearCache()\n. When you use TF after\nthis, you will see it working quite hard to recompute a bunch of data.\n1.2.5\n\u00b6\n\n\n2016-12-13\n\n\nDocumentation update\n\n\n1.2.0\n\u00b6\n\n\n2016-12-08\n\n\nNote\nData update needed\nNew\n\u00b6\n\n\nFrequency lists\n\u00b6\n\n\nF.feature.freqList()\n: get a sorted frequency list for any\nfeature.

Personally I prefer the zero\nstarting point, but Emdros insists on positive monads and objects ids. Most\nimportant is that users do not have to add/subtract one from the numbers they\nsee in TF if they want to use it in MQL and vice versa.\n\n\nBecause of this you need to update your data too:\n\n\n1\n2\n    \ncd\n ~/github/text-fabric-data\n    git pull origin master",

In the Hebrew Bible, that means that  L.d(sentence)  will not return a\nverse, even if the verse is contained in the sentence.  This might be handy for sentences and verses, but in general this behaviour\ncauses problems. It also disturbs the expectation that with these functions you\nget  all  embedders and embeddees.  So we have lifted this restriction. Still, the results of the  L  functions have\nan ordering that takes into account the levels of the returned nodes.  Enhancement  Previously, Text-Fabric determined the levels of node types\nautomatically, based on the average slot-size of nodes within the node types. So\nbooks get a lower level than chapters than verses than phrases, etc.  However, working with cuneiform tablets revealed that containing node types may\nhave a smaller average size than contained node types. This happens when a\ncontainer type only contains small instances of the contained type and not the\nbigger ones.

He then picks a\nthread, usually a colourful one, and sends it in a perpendicular way through the\nwarp. This thread is called the \nweft\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe instrument that carries the wefts through the warp is called the \nloom\n. The\nweaver continues operating the loom, back and forth, occasionally selecting new\nwefts, until he has completed a rectangular piece of fabric, the \nweave\n.\n\n\n\n\nsource\n\n\nNow Text-Fabric, the tool, can be seen as the loom that sends features (the\nwefts) through a warp (the system of nodes and edges).\n\n\nThe features \notype\n and \noslots\n are the ones that set up the system of\nnodes and edges. That's why we call them \nwarp\n features. Every Text-Fabric\ndataset contains these two warp features. (Later on we'll see a third member of\nthe warp, \notext\n). They provide the structure of a text and its annotations,\nwithout any content. Even the text itself is left out!\n\n\n\n\nAll other information is added to the warp as \nfeatures\n (the wefts): node\nfeatures and edge features. A feature is a special aspect of the textual\ninformation, isolated as a kind of module. It is a collection of values which\ncan be woven as a weft into the warp.\n\n\nOne of the more basic things to add to the warp is the text itself. Ancient\ntexts often have several text representations, like original (Unicode)\ncharacters or transliterated characters, with or without the complete set of\ndiacritical marks. In Text-Fabric we do not have to choose between them: we can\npackage each representation into a feature, and add it to the fabric.\n\n\nA Text-Fabric data set is a warp (\notype\n, \noslots\n) plus a collection of wefts\n(all other features). We may add other features to the same warp. Data sets with\nonly wefts, but no warps, are called modules. When you use modules with a\ndataset, the modules must have been constructed around the warp of the dataset.\n\n\nWhenever you use Text-Fabric to generate new data, you are weaving a weave. The\nresulting dataset is a tight fabric of individual features (wefts), whose values\nare taken for a set of nodes (warp).\n\n\n\n\nSome features deserve a privileged place. After all, we are dealing with \ntext\n,\nso we need a bit of information about which features carry textual\nrepresentations and sectioning information (e.g. books, chapters, verses).\n\n\nThis information is not hard-wired into Text-Fabric, but it is given in the form\nof a \nconfig\n feature. A config feature has no data, only metadata. Every\nText-Fabric dataset may contain a config feature called \notext\n, which\nspecifies which node types and features correspond to sectional units such as\nbooks, chapters, and verses. It also contains templates for generating text\nrepresentations for the slots.\n\n\nThe \notext\n feature is optional, because not all Text-Fabric datasets are\nexpected to have extensive sectioning and text representation definitions.\nEspecially when you are in the process of converting a data source (such as a\ntreebanks set) into a Text-Fabric dataset, it is handy that Text-Fabric can load\nthe data without bothering about these matters.\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe summarize in brief statements our data model, including ways to represent the\ndata, serialize it, and compute with it.\n\n\nText objects:\n\n\n\n\noccupy arbitrary compositions of slots;\n\n\ncarry a \ntype\n (just a label); all \nslots\n carry the same type, the \nslot\n    type\n; e.g. \nword\n or \ncharacter\n;\n\n\ncan be annotated by \nfeatures\n (key-value pairs)\n\n\ncan be connected by directed, labelled links to other text objects.\n\n\n\n\nThe model knows which feature assigned values to nodes and edges. If two\ndifferent features assign a value to an edge or node, both values can be read\noff later; one through the one feature, and one through the other.\n\n\nThe data in Text-Fabric is organized as an annotated directed graph with a bit\nof additional structure. The correspondence is\n\n\n\n\ntext positions => the first so many slot numbers\n\n\ntext objects => nodes\n\n\nlinks between text objects => edges\n\n\ninformation associated with text objects => node features\n\n\nlabels on links between text objects => edge features\n\n\nNB:\n since every link is specified by an edge feature, every link is\n    implicitly labelled by the name of the edge feature. If the edge feature\n    assigns values to edges, those values come on top of the implicit label.\n\n\ntypes of text objects => a special node feature called \notype\n (read: object\n    type)\n\n\nextent of text objects in terms of slots => a special edge feature called\n    \noslots\n (read: object slots)\n\n\noptional specifications for sectioning and representing text => a special\n    config feature called \notext\n (read: object text)\n\n\n\n\nTogether, the \notype\n, \noslots\n, and the optional \notext\n features are called\nthe \nwarp\n of a Text-Fabric dataset.\n\n\nRepresentation\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe represent the elements that make up such a graph as follows:\n\n\n\n\nnodes are integers, starting with 1, without gaps;\n\n\nthe first \nmaxSlot\n nodes correspond exactly with the slots, in the same\n    order, where \nmaxSlot\n is the number of slots;\n\n\nnodes greater than \nmaxSlot\n correspond to general text objects;\n\n\nnode features are mappings of integers to values;\n\n\nedge features are mappings of pairs of integers to values; i.e. edges are\n    ordered pairs of integers; labelled edges are ordered tuples of two nodes and\n    a value;\n\n\nvalues (for nodes and for edges) are strings (Unicode, utf8) or numbers;\n\n\nthe \notype\n feature maps\n\n\nthe integers \n1..maxSlot\n (including) to the \nslot type\n, where \nmaxSlot\n is\n    the last \nslot\n,\n\n\nthe integers \nmaxSlot+1..maxNode\n (including) to the relevant text object\n    types;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe \noslots\n feature is an valueless edge feature, mapping all non-slot nodes\n    to sets of slots; so there is an \noslots\n edge between each non-slot node and\n    each slot \ncontained\n by that node;\n\n\na Text-Fabric dataset is a collection of node features and edge features\n    containing at least the \nwarp\n features \notype\n, \noslots\n, and, optionally\n    \notext\n.\n\n\n\n\nMore about the warp\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe warp/weft distinction is a handy way of separating textual organisation from\ntextual content. Let us discuss the warp features a bit more.\n\n\notype: node feature\n\u00b6\n\n\nMaps each node to a label. The label typically is the kind of object that the\nnode represents, with values such as\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nbook\nchapter\nverse\nsentence\nclause\nphrase\nword\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a special kind of object type, the \nslot type\n, which is the atomic\nbuilding block of the text objects. It is assumed that the complete text is\nbuilt from a sequence of \nslots\n, from slot \n1\n till slot \nmaxSlot\n (including),\nwhere the slots are numbered consecutively. There must be at least one slot.\n\n\nAll other objects are defined with respect to the \nslots\n they contain.\n\n\nThe \nslot type\n does not have to be called \nslot\n literally. If your basic\nentity is \nword\n, you may also call it \nword\n. Slots are then filled with\n\nwords\n. You can model text on the basis of another atomic entity, such as\n\ncharacter\n. In that case, slots are filled with \ncharacters\n. Other choices may\nbe equally viable.\n\n\nThe only requirement is that all slots correspond exactly with the first so many\nnodes.\n\n\nThe \notype\n feature will map node \n1\n to a node type, and this node type is the\ntype of all subsequent slots and also of the things that fill the slots.\n\n\nNote also the sectional features \nbook chapter verse\n here. They will play a\nrole in the third, optional, warp feature \notext\n.\n\n\noslots: edge feature\n\u00b6\n\n\nDefines which slots are occupied by which objects. It does so by specifying\nedges from nodes to the slots they contain.\n\n\nFrom the information in \noslots\n we can compute the embedding relationships\nbetween all nodes.\n\n\nIt gives also rise to a canonical \nordering\n of nodes.\n\n\notext: config feature (optional)\n\u00b6\n\n\nDeclares which node types correspond to the first three levels of sectioning,\nusually \nbook\n, \nchapter\n, \nverse\n. Also declares the corresponding features to\nget the names or numbers of the sections in those levels. Text-Fabric uses this\ninformation to construct the so-called Text-API, with functions to\n\n\n\n\nconvert nodes to section labels and vice versa,\n\n\nrepresent section names in multiple languages,\n\n\nprint formatted text for node sets.\n\n\n\n\nIf information about sections or text representations are missing, Text-Fabric\nwill build a reduced Text-API for you, but it will continue.\n\n\nSerializing and precomputing\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen Text-Fabric works with a dataset, it reads feature data files, and offers\nan API to process that data. The main task of Text-Fabric is to make processing\nefficient, so that it can be done in interactive ways, such as in a Jupyter\nnotebook. To that end, Text-Fabric\n\n\n\n\noptimizes feature data after reading it for the first time and stores it in\n    binary form for fast loading in next invocations;\n\n\nprecomputes additional data from the warp features in order to provide\n    convenient API functions.\n\n\n\n\nIn Text-Fabric, we have various ways of encoding this model:\n\n\n\n\nas plain text in \n.tf\n feature files,\n\n\nas Python data structures in memory,\n\n\nas compressed serializations of the same data structures inside \n.tfx\n files\n    in \n.tf\n cache directories.",

It is a device that may be used if you want\nto optimize the size of data files that you want to distribute.\n\n\nOmitting empty values\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf the value is the empty string, you may also leave out the preceding tab (if\nthere is one). This is especially good for edge features, because most edges\njust consist of a node pair without any value.\n\n\nThis optimization will cause a conceptual ambiguity if there is only one field\npresent in a node feature, or if there are only two fields in an edge feature.\nIt could mean that the (first) node spec has been left out, or that the value\nhas been left out.\n\n\nIn those cases we will assume that the node spec has been left out for node\nfeatures.\n\n\nFor edge features, it depends on whether the edge is declared to have values\n(with \n@edgeValues\n). If the edge has values, then, as in the case of node\nfeatures, we assume that the first node spec has been left out. But if the edge\nhas no values, then we assume that both fields are node specs.\n\n\nSo, in a node feature a line like this\n\n\n1\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeans that the implicit node gets value \n42\n, and not that node \n42\n gets the\nempty value.\n\n\nLikewise, a line in an edge feature (without values) like this\n\n\n1\n42 43\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeans that there is an edge from \n42\n to \n43\n with empty value, and not that\nthere is an edge from the implicit node to \n42\n with value 43.\n\n\nAnd, in the same edge, a line like this\n\n\n1\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeans that there is an edge from the implicit node to \n42\n with the empty value.\n\n\nBut, in an edge with values, the same lines are interpreted thus:\n\n\n1\n42 43\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeans that there is an edge from the implicit node to node \n42\n with value \n43\n.\n\n\nAnd\n\n\n1\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeans that there is an edge from the implicit node to node \n42\n with empty\nvalue.\n\n\nThe reason for these conventions is practical: edge features usually have empty\nlabels, and there are many edges. In case of the Hebrew Text database, there are\n1.5 million edges, so every extra character that is needed on a data line means\nthat the file size increases with 1.5 MB.\n\n\nNodes on the other hand, usually do not have empty values, and they are often\nspecified in a consecutive way, especially slot (word) nodes. There are quite\nmany distinct word features, and it would be a waste to have a column of half a\nmillion incremental integers in those files.\n\n\nAbsence of values\n\u00b6\n\n\nSay you have a node feature assigning a value to only 2000 of 400,000 nodes.\n(The Hebrew \nqere\n would be an example). It is better to make sure that the\nabsent values are not coded as the empty string. So the feature data will look\nlike 2000 lines, each with a node spec, rather than a sequence of 400,000 lines,\nmost empty.\n\n\nIf you want to leave out just a few isolated cases in a feature where most nodes\nget a value, you can do it like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n@node\n\nx0000\n...\nx1000\n1002 x1002\nx1003\n...\nx9999\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere all 10,000 nodes get a value, except node \n1001\n.\n\n\nNote on redundancy\n\u00b6\n\n\nSome features assign the same value to many nodes. It is tempting to make a\nvalue definition facility, so that values are coded by short codes, the most\nfrequent values getting the shortest codes. After some experiments, it turned\nout that the overall gain was just 50%.\n\n\nI find this advantage too small to justify the increased code complexity, and\nabove all, the reduced transparency of the \n.tf\n files.\n\n\nExamples\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere are a few more and less contrived examples of legal feature data lines.\n\n\nNode features\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\\t\\n\n\n\n2 2\\t3\n\n\nfoo\\nbar\n\n\n1 Escape \\t as \\\\t\n\n\n\n\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\nnode 1 has value: \ntab\n \nnewline\n\n\nnode 2 has value: 2 \ntab\n 3\n\n\nnode 3 has value: foo \nnewline\n bar\n\n\nnode 1 gets a new value: Escape \n as \\t\n\n\n\n\nEdge features\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n1 2\n\n\n2 3 foo\n\n\n1-2 2-3 bar\n\n\n\n\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\nedge from 1 to 1 with no value\n\n\nedge from 1 to 2 with no value\n\n\nedge from 2 to 3 with value foo\n\n\nfour edges: 1->2, 1->3, 2->2, 2->3, all with value bar.

So, in a node feature a line like this  1 42   means that the implicit node gets value  42 , and not that node  42  gets the\nempty value.  Likewise, a line in an edge feature (without values) like this  1 42 43   means that there is an edge from  42  to  43  with empty value, and not that\nthere is an edge from the implicit node to  42  with value 43.  And, in the same edge, a line like this  1 42   means that there is an edge from the implicit node to  42  with the empty value.  But, in an edge with values, the same lines are interpreted thus:  1 42 43   means that there is an edge from the implicit node to node  42  with value  43 .  And  1 42   means that there is an edge from the implicit node to node  42  with empty\nvalue.  The reason for these conventions is practical: edge features usually have empty\nlabels, and there are many edges. In case of the Hebrew Text database, there are\n1.5 million edges, so every extra character that is needed on a data line means\nthat the file size increases with 1.5 MB.  Nodes on the other hand, usually do not have empty values, and they are often\nspecified in a consecutive way, especially slot (word) nodes. There are quite\nmany distinct word features, and it would be a waste to have a column of half a\nmillion incremental integers in those files.",

In it we\ndiscern the structures we are interested in: little pieces of fabric, also with\ninterconnected material.\n\n\nWhen we search, we have a fabric in mind, woven from specific material, stitched\ntogether in a specific manner.\n\n\nSearch in Text-Fabric works exactly like this: you give a sample patch, and\nText-Fabric fetches all pieces of the big fabric that match your patch.\n\n\n\n\nThe textile metaphor is particularly suited for grasping the search part of\nText-Fabric, so I'm going to stick to it for a while. I have used it in the\nactual code as well, and even in the proofs that certain parts of the algorithm\nterminate and are correct. Yet it remains a metaphor, and the fit is not exact.\n\n\nThe basic pattern of search is this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntextile\n\n\ntext\n\n\nexample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntake several fleeces\n\n\npick the nodes corresponding to a node type\n\n\nword\ns, \nphrase\ns, \nclause\ns, \nverse\ns\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspin thick yarns from them\n\n\nfilter by feature conditions\n\n\npart-of-speech=verb\n gender=\nf\n \nbook=Genesis\n \nvt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nspin the yarns further into thin yarns\n\n\nthrow away nodes that do not have the right connections\n\n\nfeature conditions on a verse also affect the search space for sentences, clauses, etc., and vice versa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstitch the yarns together with thread\n\n\nbuild results by selecting a member for every filtered node set\n\n\nword\n node \n123456\n in \nphrase\n node \n657890\n in \nclause\n node \n490567\n in \nverse\n node \n1403456\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will explain the stages of the fabrication process in detail.\n\n\nFleece\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nA fleece corresponds with a very simple search template that asks for all\nobjects of a given type:\n\n\n1\nword\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\n1\nclause\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor, asking for multiple types:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nverse\nclause\nphrase\nlex\nword\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFleeces are the raw material from which we fabricate our search results.\n\n\nEvery node type, such as \nword\n, \nsentence\n, \nbook\n corresponds to a fleece. In\nText-Fabric, every node has exactly one node type, so the whole space is neatly\ndivided into a small set of fleeces.\n\n\nThe most important characteristic of a fleece is it size: the number of nodes in\na node type.\n\n\nSpinning thick yarn\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nConsider search templates where we ask for specific members of a node type, by\ngiving feature constraints:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nverse book=Genesis\nclause type=rela\nphrase determined=yes\nlex id=jc/\nword number=pl vt\nvt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery line in this search templates we call an \natom\n: a node type plus a\nfeature specification. The result of an atom is the set of all nodes in that\nnode type that satisfy those feature conditions. Finding the results of an atom\ncorresponds with first thing that we do with a fleece: \nspin\n a thick \nyarn\n\nfrom it. Yarns in general are obtained by spinning fleeces, i.e. by filtering\nnode sets that correspond to a node type.\n\n\nA search template may contain multiple atoms. Text-Fabric collects all atoms of\na template, grabs the corresponding fleeces, and spins thick yarns from them.\nFor each atom it will spin a yarn, and if there are several atoms referring to\nthe same node type, there will be several yarns spun from that fleece. This\nspinning of thick yarns out of fleeces happens in just one go. All fleeces\ntogether contain exactly all nodes, so Text-Fabric walks in one pass over all\nnodes, applies the feature conditions, and puts the nodes into the yarns\ndepending on which conditions apply.\n\n\nBy the way, for the Hebrew dataset, we have 1.4 million nodes, and a typical\npass requires a fraction of a second.\n\n\nThe most important characteristic of a yarn is its \nthickness\n, which we define\nas the number of nodes in the yarn divided by the number of nodes in the fleece.\n\n\nFor example, a yarn consisting of the \nbook\n node of Genesis only, has a\nthickness of 1/39, because there are 39 books in the fleece. A much thicker yarn\nis that of the verbs, which has a thickness of roughly 1/6. A very thin thread\nis that of the word \n<CQH\n (which occurs only once) with a thickness of only\n1/400,000.\n\n\nSpinning thin yarns\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to find results, we have to further narrow down the search space. In\nother words, we are going to spin our thick yarns into thinner and thinner\nyarns. Before we can do that, we should make one thing clear.\n\n\nConnected by constraints\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf the template above were complete, it would lead to a monstrous number of\nresults. Because a result of a template like this is any combination of verse-,\nclause-, phrase-, lex-, word nodes that individually satisfy their own atom\ncondition. So the number of results is the product of the number of results of\nthe individual atoms, which is pretty enormous. It is hard to imagine a\nsituation where these results could be consumed.\n\n\nUsually, there are \nconstraints\n active between the atoms. For example in a\ntemplate like this:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n1 verse book=Genesis\n2    clause type=rela\n3        phrase determined=yes\n4            w:word number=pl vt\n5\n6 l:lex id=jc/\n7\n8 w ]] l\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meaning of this template is that we look for a \nverse\n that\n\n\n\n\n(1) claims to be in Genesis\n\n\n(2) has a clause whose type is \nrela\n\n\n(3) which in turn has a phrase of a determined character\n\n\n(4) which contains a word in the plural and that has a verbal tense (vt)\n\n\n\n\nThere should also be a\n\n\n\n\n(6) lex object, identified by \njc/\n\n\n\n\nwhich is connected to the rest by the constraint that\n\n\n\n\n(8) the word of line 4 is contained in it.\n\n\n\n\nNote that all atoms are linked by constraints into one network. In graph\ntheoretical terms: this template consists of exactly one\n\nconnected component\n.\n\n\nIf this were not so, we would have in fact two independent search tasks, where\nthe result set would be the (cartesian) product of the result sets of the\nseparate components.\n\n\nFor example, if line 8 were missing, we would effectively search for things that\nmatch lines 1-4, and, independently, for things that match line 6. And every\nresult of the first part, combined with any result of the second part, would be\na valid result of the whole.\n\n\nWell, Text-Fabric is nobody's fool: it refuses to accept two search tasks at the\nsame time, let alone that it wants to waste time to generate all the results in\nthe product. You will have to fire those search tasks one by one, and it is up\nto you how you combine the results.\n\n\nThe upshot it: \nthe atoms in the search template should form a network,\nconnected by constraints\n.\n\n\nText-Fabric will check this, and will only work with search templates that have\nonly one connected component.\n\n\nTerminology\n\u00b6\n\n\nBy now we have arrived at the idea that our search template is a graph\nunderneath: what we have called \natoms\n are in fact the nodes, and what we have\ncalled \nconstraints\n, are the edges.\n\n\nFrom now on, we will call the \natoms\n \nqnodes\n and the constraints \nqedges\n.\nThe \nq\n is to distinguish the nodes and the edges from the nodes and the edges\nof your dataset, the \ntext\n nodes and \ntext\n edges. When we use the term \nnodes\n\nand \nedges\n we will always refer to \ntext\n nodes and edges.\n\n\nWhen we are searching, we maintain a \nyarn\n for every \nqnode\n. This yarn starts\nout to be the thick yarn as described above, but we are going to thin them.\n\n\nWe can also see how our query templates are really \ntopographic\n: a query\ntemplate is a piece of local geography that we want to match against the data.\nFinding results is nothing else than instantiating \nqnodes\n of the search\ntemplate by text nodes in such a way that the \nqedges\n hold between the text\nedges.\n\n\nSpinning a qedge\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nSo, where were we? We have spun thick threads based on the \nqnodes\n\nindividually, but we have not done anything with the \nqedges\n. That is going to\nchange now.\n\n\nConsider this piece of search template:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4            w:word number=pl vt\n5\n6 l:lex id=jc/\n7\n8 w ]] l\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo our \nqnodes\n are \nw\n and \nl\n, and our \nqedge\n is \nw ]] l\n. Note that a \nlex\n\nobject is the set of all occurrences of a lexeme. So \nw ]] l\n says that \nw\n is\nembedded in \nl\n, in other words, \nw\n is a slot contained in the slots of \nl\n. It\nis nothing else than the word \nw\n is an instance of the lexeme \njc/\n.\n\n\nWe will now check the pairs of (lex, word)-nodes in the text, where the lex node\nis taken from the yarn of the qnode \nl\n, and the word from the yarn of the qnode\n\nw\n.\n\n\nWe can throw away some words from the yarn of \nw\n, namely those words that do\nnot lie in a lexeme that is in the yarn of \nl\n. In other words: the words that\nare not instances of lexeme \njc/\n are out!\n\n\nConversely, if the lexeme \njc/\n does not have occurrences in the plural and with\na verbal tense, we must kick it out of the yarn of \nl\n, leaving no members in\nit. If a yarn gets empty, we have an early detection that the search yields no\nresults, and the whole process stops.\n\n\nIn our case, however, this is not so, and we continue.\n\n\nThis pass over the yarns at both sides of a qedge is a \nspin\n action. We spin\nthis qedge, and the result is that the two yarns become spun more thinly,\nhopefully.\n\n\n\n\nWith the yarn of words severely spun out, we are going to the next qedge, the\none between words and phrases.\n\n\n1\n2\n3        phrase determined=yes\n4            w:word number=pl vt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe indent is an implicit way of saying that the \"embeds\" relation \n[[\n holds\nbetween the \nphrase\n and the \nword\n. An equivalent formulation of the template\nis\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\np:phrase determined=yes\nw:word number=pl vt\n\np [[ w\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe race along the yarn \nw\n of remaining words and check for each word if it is\ncontained in a phrase in the yarn of \np\n, the determined phrases. If it is not,\nwe throw the word out of the yarn of \nw\n. Similarly, we can throw out some\nphrases from the yarn of \np\n, namely those phrases that do not contain words in\nthe yarn of \nw\n. In other words: the phrases without plural words and verbal\ntense are also out.\n\n\n\n\nWe continue spinning, now between phrases and clauses.\n\n\n1\n2\n2    clause type=rela\n3        phrase determined=yes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we loose the phrases that are not contained in a clause of \ntype=rela\n, and\nwe loose all clauses that do not embed one of the few phrases left.\n\n\n\n\nThe last spin action corresponds with\n\n\n1\n2\n1 verse book=Genesis\n2    clause type=rela\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we throw away all our results if they are outside Genesis.\n\n\nWe end up with a set of thin yarns, severely thinned out, even. This will be a\ngood starting point for the last stage: picking members from each yarn to form\nresults. We call this \nstitching\n and we'll get there in a moment.\n\n\nThe spread of a qedge\n\u00b6\n\n\nA very important property of a qedge is its \nspread\n. A qedge links every node\n\nn\n in its \nfrom\n-yarn to zero, one, or more nodes in its \nto\n-yarn. The number\nof nodes in the \nto\n-yarn is a key property. The average number of nodes \nm\n in\nthe \nto\n-yarn per linked node \nn\n in the \nfrom\n-yarn is the \nspread\n of the\nedge.\n\n\nA few examples:\n\n\n\n\nAn edge that corresponds to \n]]\n, \nn\n embeds \nm\n. If this edge goes from books\n    to words, then every book node \nn\n is linked to every one of its words. So\n    very \nn\n has hundreds or thousands \nm\ns. The spread will roughly be 425,000 /\n    39 =~ 10,000\n\n\nThe opposite edge has a spread of exactly 1, because every word belongs to\n    exactly one book. Edges with spread 1 are very pleasant for our stitching\n    algorithm later on.\n\n\nAn edge corresponding to \n=\n. These qedges are super efficient, because their\n    relation \n=\n is a breeze to compute, and they have always a spread 1 in both\n    directions.\n\n\nAn edge corresponding to \n#\n, the node inequality relation. The relation \n#\n\n    is still a breeze to compute, but the result is heavy: the set of all nodes\n    not equal to a given node. The spread is nearly 100% of the yarn length, in\n    both directions. These edges are not worth to spin, because if you have two\n    yarns, no node will be excluded: if you have an \nn\n in the \nfrom\n-yarn, you\n    will always be able to find a different \nn\n in the \nto\n-yarn (except when bot\n    yarns are equal, and contain just one node).\n\n\nAn edge corresponding to \n==\n, the relation between nodes that are linked to\n    the same set of slots. The spread of this relation is not too big, but the\n    cost of computing it adds up quickly when applied to many cases.\n\n\n\n\nSpinning all qedges\n\u00b6\n\n\nLet us describe the spinning of yarns along edges in a bit more general way, and\nreflect on what it does for us.\n\n\nWe spin all qedges of a template. But after spinning a qedge, the yarns involved\nmay have changed. If that is the case, it makes sense to re-spin other qedges\nthat are involved in the changed yarns.\n\n\nThat is exactly what we do. We keep spinning, until the yarns have stabilized.\n\n\nA few key questions need to be addressed:\n\n\n\n\nDo the yarns stabilize?\n\n\nIf they stabilize, what have we got?\n\n\nIs this an efficient process?\n\n\n\n\nTermination of spinning\n\u00b6\n\n\nYes, spinning qedges until nothing changes any more, terminates, provided you do\nnot try to spin qedges that are up-to-date. If the yarns around an edge have not\nchanged, it does not make sense to spin that qedge. See\n\nhere\n\nfor proof.\n\n\nWhat have we got?\n\u00b6\n\n\nAfter spinning, it is guaranteed that we have not thrown away results. All nodes\nthat are parts of valid results, are still in the yarns.\n\n\nBut, conversely, can it be that there are still nodes in the yarns that are not\npart of a result? Yes, that is possible.\n\n\nOnly when the graph of qnodes and qedges does not have a cycle, we know that all\nmembers of all yarns occur at least once in a result. See\n\nhere\n\nfor proof.\n\n\nQuite a few interesting queries, however, have cycles in in their graphs. So, in\nthose cases, spinning qedges will not cause the maximal narrowing down of the\nsearch space.\n\n\nEfficiency\n\u00b6\n\n\nAnd that raises the question: how effective is the process of spinning qedges?\n\n\nThe answer is: it depends. If your qnodes have strong conditions on them, so\nthat the first yarn is already very thin, then every yarn that is connected to\nthis one by a qedge has also the chance to get very thin after spinning. In this\ncase, the combined filtering effect of all edges can produce a rapid narrowing\nof the search space.\n\n\nEspecially if we can implement edge spinning in an optimized way, this works\nlike a charm. When we come to stitching results (which is potentially very\nexpensive), we have already achieved a massive reduction of work.\n\n\nBut if none of the yarns is thin at the outset, spinning qedges will not result\nin appreciable thinning of the yarns, while it might be an enormous amount of\nwork, depending on the actual relations involved.\n\n\nThe good news is that it is possible to detect those situations. Text-Fabric\nestimates whether it makes sense to spin a qedge, and if not, it will just skip\nspinning that edge. Which will make the final result gathering (stitching) more\nexpensive.\n\n\nThere is more to efficiency than this. It turns out that the strategy by which\nyou select the next qedge to be spun, influences the efficiency. In general, it\nis best to always start with the thinnest yarns, and select edges that affect\nthem. Also here there is complication: not every qedge is equally expensive when\ncomputed over a yarn. It might be better to compute a cheaper edge over a\nthicker yarn.\n\n\nStitching\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nThe last step is actually getting results. A result is a bunch of nodes, one\nfrom each yarn, in such a way that result nodes on yarns fulfil the\nrelationships that the qedges of the search template dictate. If we can find\nsuch a set of nodes, we have stitched the yarns together. We call such a result\na \nstitch\n. A stitch is a tuple of text nodes, each corresponding to exactly one\nqnode.\n\n\nIt is not completely trivial to find stitches, let alone to collect them\nefficiently. The general procedure is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nchoose a yarn to start with;\n\n\ntry a node in that yarn as starting point\n\n\npick a qedge from the qnode associated with the yarn (the source yarn), to\n    another qnode and consider that yarn (the target yarn),\n\n\nfind a node in the target yarn that is in the right relationship with the node\n    selected in the source yarn,\n\n\nand so on, until all qedges have been used,\n\n\nif all has gone well, deliver the nodes found as a result.\n\n\n\n\nLet us look to these steps in a bit more detail. There is an element of choice,\nand it is very important to study how big this element of choice is in the\nvarious stages.\n\n\nFirst we select a yarn, and in that yarn a node. Usually we have many choices\nand at least one, because result seeking only makes sense if all yarns are\nnon-empty. The third choice is the related node in the target yarn. Here we may\nencounter anything from zero, one or many choices.\n\n\nIf there are zero choices, then we know that our provisional stitching of yarns\nso far cannot be completed into a full stitching of all yarns. If we have made\nchoices to get this far, then some of these choices have not been lucky. We have\nto back-track and try other alternatives.\n\n\nIf there is just one choice, it is easy: we pick the one and only possible node\nin the target yarn, without introducing new points of choice.\n\n\nIf there are many choices, we have to try them all, one by one. Some might lead\nto a full stitch, others not.\n\n\nAn important situation to be aware of, is when a qedge leads the stitching\nprocess to a yarn, out of which a node has already been chosen by an earlier\nstep. This is very well possible, since the search template might have cycles in\nthe qedges, or multiple qedges arrive at the same qnode.\n\n\nWhen this happens, we do not have to select a target node, we only have to check\nwhether the target node that has been selected before, stands in the right\nrelationship to the current source node. The relationship, that is, which is\ndictated by the current qedge that we are at. If so, we can stitch on with other\nedges, without introducing choice points (very much like the one-choice above).\nIf the relation fails to hold, this stitch is doomed, and we have to back-track\n(very much like the zero-choice above).\n\n\nStrategy of stitching\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe steps involved in stitching as described above are clear, but less clear is\nwhat yarn we shall select to start with, and in which order we shall follow the\nedges. We need a strategy, and multiple strategies might lead to the same\nresults, albeit with varying efficiency.\n\n\nIn Text-Fabric we employ a strategy, that makes the \nnarrowest\n choices first.\nWe call a choice narrow if there are few alternatives to choose from, and broad\nif there are many alternatives.\n\n\nBy giving precedence to narrow choices, we prune larger parts of the search tree\nwhen we fail. If we are stitching, the more nodes we have gathered in our\nstitch, the greater the chance that a blocking relationship is encountered, i.e.\na relationship that should hold between the nodes gathered so far, but which in\nfact does not hold.\n\n\nSo we want to get as many nodes in our stitch as quickly as possible.\n\n\nIf our search tree is narrowly branching near the root, and broadly branching\nnear the leaves, the top \nn\n levels of the tree contain relatively few nodes. So\nwe have relatively few possibilities to stitch n nodes together, and most\nreasons to fail will happen while visiting these \nn\n levels.\n\n\nIf on the other hand our search tree is broadly branching near the root, and\nnarrowly branching near the leaves, the top \nn\n levels of the tree contain many\nnodes. We will visit many nodes and try many stitchings of length \nn\n, of which\na lot will fail.\n\n\nI have also tried a different, more complicated strategy, which is still\nimplemented, and which can be used by means of an optional argument to\n\nS.study()\n,\nbut results of this strategy were not particularly good.\n\n\nSmall-first strategy\n\u00b6\n\n\nHere is the small-first strategy in a bit more detail.\n\n\n\n\nwe choose the smallest yarn to start with;\n\n\nfor every qedge we estimate its current \nspread\n, i.e. how many targets it has\n    per source on average, relative to the current source and target yarns;\n\n\nat every step there are three kinds of qedges:\n\n\nqedges that go between qnodes of which we have already stitched the yarns\n\n\nqedges that go from a yarn that is already part of the stitch to a yarn\n    outside the stitch\n\n\nqedges that do not start at a yarn in the current stitch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nat every step,\n\n\nwe first process all qedges of type (i), in arbitrary order;\n\n\nwe select one edge with minimal spread out of type (ii) and process it;\n\n\nwe postpone all edges of type (iii);\n\n\nwe redetermine which edges are in all types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt cannot happen that at the end we have not visited all qnodes and yarns,\nbecause we have assumed that our search template consists of one connected\ncomponent. Every qnode can be reached from every other through a series of\nqedges. So, as we perform step after step, as long as there are qnodes in type\n(iii), we can be sure that there are also qnodes in a path from the qnodes we\nhave visited to the type (iii) qnodes. At least one of the qnodes in that path\nwill be a type (ii) node. In the end there will no type (iii) nodes be left.\n\n\nWe have added a few more things to optimize the process.\n\n\nA relationship between a source yarn and a target yarn can also be considered in\nthe opposite direction. If its spread in the opposite direction is less than its\nspread in the normal direction, we use the opposite direction.\n\n\nSecondly, before we start stitching, we can compute the order of qedges that we\nwill use for every stitch. We then sort the qnodes according to the order by\nwhich they will be encountered when we work through the qedges. When we are\nstitching, in the midst of a partial stitch, it is always the case that we have\nstitched qnodes 1 .. \nn\n for some \nn\n, and we still have to stitch all qnodes\nabove \nn\n. That means that when we try to finish partial stitches of which an\ninitial part has been fixed, the search process will not change that initial\npart of the stitch. Only when the algorithm has exhausted all possibilities\nbased on that initial part, it will change the last node of the initial part,\nreplace it by other options, and start searching further.\n\n\nThis means that we just can maintain our partial stitch in a single list. We do\nnot have to assemble many partial stitches as separate immutable tuples.\n\n\nWe have implemented our deliver function as a generator, that walks over all\nstitch possibilities while maintaining just one current stitch. When the stitch\nhas been completely filled in, a copy of it will be yielded, after which\nback-tracking occurs, by which the current stitch will get partly undefined,\nonly to be filled up again by further searching.\n\n\nRead it all in the source code:\n\ndef stitchOn(e)\n.",

Yarns in general are obtained by spinning fleeces, i.e. by filtering\nnode sets that correspond to a node type.  A search template may contain multiple atoms.

The good news is that it is possible to detect those situations. Text-Fabric\nestimates whether it makes sense to spin a qedge, and if not, it will just skip\nspinning that edge.

It turns out that the strategy by which\nyou select the next qedge to be spun, influences the efficiency.

A result is a bunch of nodes, one\nfrom each yarn, in such a way that result nodes on yarns fulfil the\nrelationships that the qedges of the search template dictate. If we can find\nsuch a set of nodes, we have stitched the yarns together. We call such a result\na  stitch . A stitch is a tuple of text nodes, each corresponding to exactly one\nqnode.  It is not completely trivial to find stitches, let alone to collect them\nefficiently. The general procedure is as follows:   choose a yarn to start with;  try a node in that yarn as starting point  pick a qedge from the qnode associated with the yarn (the source yarn), to\n    another qnode and consider that yarn (the target yarn),  find a node in the target yarn that is in the right relationship with the node\n    selected in the source yarn,  and so on, until all qedges have been used,  if all has gone well, deliver the nodes found as a result.   Let us look to these steps in a bit more detail. There is an element of choice,\nand it is very important to study how big this element of choice is in the\nvarious stages.  First we select a yarn, and in that yarn a node. Usually we have many choices\nand at least one, because result seeking only makes sense if all yarns are\nnon-empty. The third choice is the related node in the target yarn. Here we may\nencounter anything from zero, one or many choices.  If there are zero choices, then we know that our provisional stitching of yarns\nso far cannot be completed into a full stitching of all yarns. If we have made\nchoices to get this far, then some of these choices have not been lucky. We have\nto back-track and try other alternatives.  If there is just one choice, it is easy: we pick the one and only possible node\nin the target yarn, without introducing new points of choice.  If there are many choices, we have to try them all, one by one. Some might lead\nto a full stitch, others not.  An important situation to be aware of, is when a qedge leads the stitching\nprocess to a yarn, out of which a node has already been chosen by an earlier\nstep. This is very well possible, since the search template might have cycles in\nthe qedges, or multiple qedges arrive at the same qnode.  When this happens, we do not have to select a target node, we only have to check\nwhether the target node that has been selected before, stands in the right\nrelationship to the current source node. The relationship, that is, which is\ndictated by the current qedge that we are at. If so, we can stitch on with other\nedges, without introducing choice points (very much like the one-choice above).\nIf the relation fails to hold, this stitch is doomed, and we have to back-track\n(very much like the zero-choice above).",

It cannot happen that at the end we have not visited all qnodes and yarns,\nbecause we have assumed that our search template consists of one connected\ncomponent. Every qnode can be reached from every other through a series of\nqedges. So, as we perform step after step, as long as there are qnodes in type\n(iii), we can be sure that there are also qnodes in a path from the qnodes we\nhave visited to the type (iii) qnodes. At least one of the qnodes in that path\nwill be a type (ii) node. In the end there will no type (iii) nodes be left.  We have added a few more things to optimize the process.  A relationship between a source yarn and a target yarn can also be considered in\nthe opposite direction. If its spread in the opposite direction is less than its\nspread in the normal direction, we use the opposite direction.  Secondly, before we start stitching, we can compute the order of qedges that we\nwill use for every stitch. We then sort the qnodes according to the order by\nwhich they will be encountered when we work through the qedges. When we are\nstitching, in the midst of a partial stitch, it is always the case that we have\nstitched qnodes 1 ..  n  for some  n , and we still have to stitch all qnodes\nabove  n . That means that when we try to finish partial stitches of which an\ninitial part has been fixed, the search process will not change that initial\npart of the stitch. Only when the algorithm has exhausted all possibilities\nbased on that initial part, it will change the last node of the initial part,\nreplace it by other options, and start searching further.  This means that we just can maintain our partial stitch in a single list. We do\nnot have to assemble many partial stitches as separate immutable tuples.  We have implemented our deliver function as a generator, that walks over all\nstitch possibilities while maintaining just one current stitch. When the stitch\nhas been completely filled in, a copy of it will be yielded, after which\nback-tracking occurs, by which the current stitch will get partly undefined,\nonly to be filled up again by further searching.

It will search a set of directories\nand catalog all \n.tf\n files it finds there.\nThese are the features you can subsequently load.\nHere \ndirectories\n and \nsubdirectories\n are strings with directory names\nseparated by newlines, or iterables of directories.\nlocations, modules\nThe directories specified in \nlocations\n will be searched for \nmodules\n, which\nare paths that will be appended to the paths in \nlocations\n.\nAll \n.tf\n files (non-recursively) in any \nmodule\n will be added to the feature\nset to be loaded in this session. The order in \nmodules\n is important, because\nif a feature occurs in multiple modules, the last one will be chosen. In this\nway you can easily override certain features in one module by features in an\nother module of your choice.\notext@ in modules\nIf modules contain features with a name starting with \notext@\n, then the format\ndefinitions in these features will be added to the format definitions in the\nregular \notext\n feature (which is a WARP feature). In this way, modules that\ndefine new features for text representation, also can add new formats to the\nText-API.\nDefaults\nThe \nlocations\n list has a few defaults:\n1\n2\n3\n~/Downloads/text-fabric-data\n~/text-fabric-data\n~/github/text-fabric-data\n\n\n\n\n\nSo if you have stored your main Text-Fabric dataset in\n\ntext-fabric-data\n in one of these directories\nyou do not have to pass a location to Fabric.\nThe \nmodules\n list defaults to \n['']\n. So if you leave it out, Text-Fabric will\njust search the paths specified in \nlocations\n.\nsilent\nIf \nsilent=True\n is passed, banners and normal progress messages are suppressed.\nTF.explore()\n1\n2\nfeatures\n \n=\n \nTF\n.\nexplore\n(\nsilent\n=\nFalse\n,\n \nshow\n=\nTrue\n)\n\n\nfeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n1\n2\nTF\n.\nexplore\n(\nsilent\n=\nFalse\n,\n \nshow\n=\nFalse\n)\n\n\nTF\n.\nfeatureSets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis will give you a dictionary of all available features by kind. The kinds\nare: \nnodes\n, \nedges\n, \nconfigs\n, \ncomputeds\n.\nsilent\nWith \nsilent=False\n a message containing the total numbers of features is issued.\nshow\nThe resulting dictionary is delivered in \nTF.featureSets\n, but if you say\n\nshow=True\n, the dictionary is returned as function result.\napi=TF.load()\n1\napi\n \n=\n \nTF\n.\nload\n(\nfeatures\n,\n \nadd\n=\nFalse\n,\n \nsilent\n=\nFalse\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nReads the features indicated by \nfeatures\n and loads them in memory\nready to be used in the rest of the program.\nfeatures\nfeatures\n is a string containing space separated feature names, or an\niterable of feature names. The feature names are just the names of \n.tf\n files\nwithout directory information and without extension.\nadd\nIf later on you want load more features, you can either:\nadd the features to the original \nload()\n statement and just run it again\nmake a new statement: \nTF.load(newfeatures, add=True)\n. The new features will\n    be added to the same api, so you do not have to to call\n    \napi.makeAvailableIn(globals())\n again after this!\nsilent\nThe features will be loaded rather silently, most messages will be suppressed.\nTime consuming operations will always be announced, so that you know what\nText-Fabric is doing. If \nsilent=True\n is passed, all informational messages\nwill be suppressed. This is handy I you want to load data as part of other\nmethods, on-the-fly.\napi.makeAvailableIn(globals())\n1\napi\n.\nmakeAvailableIn\n(\nglobals\n())\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis method will export every member of the API (such as \nN\n, \nF\n, \nE\n, \nL\n, \nT\n,\n\ninfo\n) to the global namespace. From now on, we will omit the \napi.\n in our\ndocumentation.\nContents of the API\nAfter having loaded the features by \napi = TF.load(...)\n, the \napi\n harbours\nyour Text-Fabric API. You can access node feature \nmydata\n by \napi.F.mydata.v(node)\n, edge\nfeature \nmylink\n by \napi.E.mylink.f(node)\n, and so on.\nIf you are working with a single data source in your program, it is a bit\ntedious to write the initial \napi.\n all the time.\nBy this methodd you can avoid that.\nLonger names\nThere are also longer names which can be used as aliases to the single capital\nletters.

Occasionally, during the walk you might want to visit\nembedding or embedded nodes to glean some feature information from them.\nMore ways of walking\nLater, under \nFeatures\n there is another convenient way to walk through\nnodes.\ncanonical order\nThe canonical order is a way to sort the nodes in your corpus in such a way\nthat you can enumerate all nodes in the order you encounter them if you\nwalk through your corpus.\nBriefly this means:\nembedder nodes come before the nodes that lie embedded in them;\nearlier stuff comes before later stuff,\nif a verse coincides with a sentence, the verse comes before the sentence,\n    because verses generally contain sentences and not the other way round;\nif two objects are intersecting, but none embeds the other, the one with the\n    smallest slot that does not occur in the other, comes first.\nfirst things first, big things first\nThat means, roughly, that you start with a\nbook node (Genesis), then a chapter node (Genesis 1), then a verse node, Genesis\n1:1, then a sentence node, then a clause node, a phrase node, and the first word\nnode. Then follow all word nodes in the first phrase, then the phrase node of\nthe second phrase, followed by the word nodes in that phrase. When ever you\nenter a higher structure, you will first get the node corresponding to that\nstructure, and after that the nodes corresponding to the building blocks of that\nstructure.\nThis concept follows the intuition that slot sets with smaller elements come\nbefore slot set with bigger elements, and embedding slot sets come before\nembedded slot sets. Hence, if you enumerate a set of nodes that happens to\nconstitute a tree hierarchy based on slot set embedding, and you enumerate those\nnodes in the slot set order, you will walk the tree in pre-order.\nThis order is a modification of the one as described in (Doedens 1994, 3.6.3).\n\nDoedens, Crist-Jan (1994), \nText Databases. One Database Model and Several\nRetrieval Languages\n, number 14 in Language and Computers, Editions Rodopi,\nAmsterdam, Netherlands and Atlanta, USA. ISBN: 90-5183-729-1,\n\nhttp://books.google.nl/books?id=9ggOBRz1dO4C\n. The order as defined by\nDoedens corresponds to walking trees in post-order.\nFor a lot of processing, it is handy to have a the stack of embedding elements\navailable when working with an element. That is the advantage of pre-order over\npost-order. It is very much like SAX parsing in the XML world.\nsortNodes()\n1\nsortNodes\n(\nnodeSet\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\ndelivers an iterable of nodes as a tuple sorted by the \ncanonical ordering\n.\nnodeSet\nAn iterable of nodes to be sorted.\nsortKey\n1\nnodeList\n \n=\n \nsorted\n(\nnodes\n,\n \nkey\n=\nsortKey\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nA function that provides for each node the key to be used to sort nodes in the\ncanonical ordering. That means that the following two pieces of code do the same\nthing:\nsortNodes(nodeSet)\n and \nsorted(nodeSet, key=sortKey)\n.\nSorting tuples of nodes\nHandy to sort things that are not nodes themselves, but data structures with\nnodes in it, e.g. search results: if \nresults\n is a list of tuples of nodes, we\ncould sort them in canonical order like this:\n1\nsorted\n(\nnodeSet\n,\n \nkey\n=\nlambda\n \nr\n:\n \nsortKey\n(\nr\n[\n0\n]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\notypeRank\n1\notypeRank\n[\n'sentence'\n]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe node types are ordered in \nC.levels.data\n, and if you reverse that list, you get\nthe rank of a type by looking at the position in which that type occurs.\nThe \nslotType\n has otypeRank 0, and the more comprehensive a type is, the higher its rank.\nLocality\n\u00b6\n\n\nLocal navigation\nHere are the methods by which you can navigate easily from a node to its\nneighbours: parents and children, previous and next siblings.\nL\nThe Locality API is exposed as \nL\n or \nLocality\n.\notype parameter\nIn all of the following \nL\n-functions, if the \notype\n parameter is passed, the result is filtered and\nonly nodes with \notype=nodeType\n are retained.\nResults of the \nL.\n functions are tuples, not single nodes\nEven if an \nL\n-function returns a single node, it is packed in a \ntuple\n.\n  So to get the node itself, you have to dereference the tuple:\n1\nL\n.\nu\n(\nnode\n)[\n0\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL.u()\n1\nL\n.\nu\n(\nnode\n,\n \notype\n=\nnodeType\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nProduces an ordered tuple of nodes \nupward\n, i.e. embedder nodes.\nnode\nThe node whose embedder nodes will be delivered.\nThe result never includes \nnode\n itself.\nL.d()\n1\nL\n.\nd\n(\nnode\n,\n \notype\n=\nnodeType\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nProduces an ordered tuple of nodes \ndownward\n, i.e. embedded nodes.\nnode\nThe node whose embedded nodes will be delivered.\nThe result never includes \nnode\n itself.\nL.n()\n1\nL\n.\nn\n(\nnode\n,\n \notype\n=\nnodeType\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nProduces an ordered tuple of adjacent \nnext\n nodes.\nnode\nThe node whose right adjacent nodes will be delivered;\ni.e. the nodes whose first slot immediately follow the last slot \nof \nnode\n.\nThe result never includes \nnode\n itself.\nL.p()\n1\nL\n.\np\n(\nnode\n,\n \notype\n=\nnodeType\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nProduces an ordered tuple of adjacent \nprevious\n nodes from \nnode\n, i.e. nodes\nwhose last slot just precedes the first slot of \nnode\n.\nDescription\nProduces an ordered tuple of adjacent \nprevious\n nodes.\nnode\nThe node whose lefy adjacent nodes will be delivered;\ni.e. the nodes whose last slot immediately precede the first slot \nof \nnode\n.\nLocality and levels\nHere is something that is very important to be aware of when using \nsortNodes\n\nand the \nL.d(n)\n and \nL.u(n)\n methods.\nWhen we order nodes and report on which nodes embed which other nodes, we do not\nonly take into account the sets of slots the nodes occupy, but also their\n\nlevel\n. See \nlevels\n and \ntext\n.\nBoth the \nL.d(n)\n and \nL.u(n)\n work as follows:\nL.d(n)\n returns nodes such that embedding nodes come before embedded nodes\n    words)\nL.u(n)\n returns nodes such that embedded nodes come before embedding nodes\n    books)\nN.B.:\n Suppose you have node types \nverse\n and \nsentence\n, and usually a\nverse has multiple sentences, but not vice versa. Then you expect that\nL.d(verseNode)\n will contain sentence nodes,\nL.d(sentenceNode)\n will \nnot\n contain verse nodes.\nBut if there is a verse with exactly one sentence, and both have exactly the\nsame words, then that is a case where:\nL.d(verseNode)\n will contain one sentence node,\nL.d(sentenceNode)\n will contain \none\n verse node.\nText\n\u00b6\n\n\nOverview\nHere are the functions that enable you to get the actual text in the dataset.\nThere are several things to accomplish here, such as\ngetting text given book, chapter, and verse;\ngiven a node, produce the book, chapter and verse indicators in which the node\n    is contained;\nhandle multilingual book names;\nswitch between various text representations.\nThe details of the Text API are dependent on the \nwarp\n feature \notext\n, which\nis a config feature.\nT\nThe Text API is exposed as \nT\n or \nText\n.\nSections\n\u00b6\n\n\nSection levels\nIn \notext\n the main section levels (usually \nbook\n, \nchapter\n, \nverse\n) can be\ndefined. It loads the features it needs (so you do not have to specify those\nfeatures, unless you want to use them via \nF\n). And finally, it makes some\nfunctions available by which you can make handy use of that information.\nSection levels are generic\nIn this documentation, we call the main section level \nbook\n, the second level\n\nchapter\n, and the third level \nverse\n. Text-Fabric, however, is completely\nagnostic about how these levels are called. It is prepared to distinguish three\nsection levels, but how they are called, must be configured in the dataset. The\ntask of the \notext\n feature is to declare which node type and feature correspond\nwith which section level. Text-Fabric assumes that the first section level may\nhave multilingual headings, but that section levels two and three have single\nlanguage headings (numbers of some kind).\nString versus number\nChapter and verse numbers will be considered to be strings or\nintegers, depending on whether your dataset has declared the corresponding\nfeature \nvalueType\n as \nstr\n or as \nint\n.\nConceivably, other works might have chapter and verse numbers\nlike \nXIV\n, '3A', '4.5', and in those cases these numbers are obviously not\n\nint\ns.\notext is optional\nIf \notext\n is missing, the Text API will not be build. If it exists, but\ndoes not specify sections, that part of the Text API will not be built. Likewise\nfor text representations.\nlevels of node types\nUsually, Text-Fabric computes the hierarchy of node types correctly, in the\nsense that node types that act as containers have a lower level than node types\nthat act as containees. So books have the lowest level, words the highest. See\n\nlevels\n. However, if this level assignment turns out to be wrong for\nyour dataset, you can configure the right order in the \notext\n feature, by means\nof a key \nlevels\n with value a comma separated list of levels.

The verse number may be left out, the result is then a\nchapter node. Both verse and chapter numbers may be left out, the result is then\na book node. If all three are present, de result is a verse node.\nlang\nThe language assumed for the section parts, as far as they are language dependent.\nBook names and languages\n\u00b6\n\n\nBook names and nodes\nThe names of the books may be available in multiple languages. The book names\nare stored in node features with names of the form \nbook@\nla\n, where \nla\n is\nthe \nISO 639\n two-letter code for that\nlanguage. Text-Fabric will always load these features.\nT.languages\n1\nT\n.\nlanguages\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nA dictionary of the languages that are available for book names.\nT.bookName()\n1\nT\n.\nbookName\n(\nnode\n,\n \nlang\n=\n'en'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\ngives the name of the book in which a node occurs.\nnode\nThe node in question.\nlang\nThe \nlang\n parameter is a two letter language code.

Instead of \nT.bookName()\n\nand \nT.bookNode()\n we have then \nT.tabletName()\n and \nT.tabletNode()\n.\nText representation\n\u00b6\n\n\nText formats\nText can be represented in multiple ways. We provide a number of formats with\nstructured names.\nA format name is a string of keywords separated by \n-\n:\nwhat\n-\nhow\n-\nfullness\n-\nmodifier\nFor Hebrew any combination of the follwoing could be useful formats:\nkeyword\nvalue\nmeaning\nwhat\ntext\nwords as they belong to the text\nwhat\nlex\nlexemes of the words\nhow\norig\nin the original script (Hebrew, Greek, Syriac) (all Unicode)\nhow\ntrans\nin (latin) transliteration\nhow\nphono\nin phonetic/phonological transcription\nfullness\nfull\ncomplete with accents and all diacritical marks\nfullness\nplain\nwith accents and diacritical marks stripped, in Hebrew only the consonants are left\nmodifier\nketiv\n(Hebrew): where there is ketiv/qere, follow ketiv instead of qere (default);\nThe default format is \ntext-orig-full\n, we assume that every TF dataset defines\nthis format.\nTF datasets may also define formats of the form \nnodetype\n-default\n where \nnodetype\n is a valid type\nof node in the dataset. These formats have a special meaning for Text-Fabric.\nRemember that the formats are defined in the \notext\n warp config feature of your\nset, not by Text-Fabric.\nFreedom of names for formats\nThere is complete freedom of choosing names for text formats.\nThey do not have to complied with the above-mentioned scheme.\nT.formats\n1\nT\n.\nformats\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nShow the text representation formats that have been defined in your dataset.\nT.text()\n1\n2\nT\n.\ntext\n(\nnodes\n,\n \nfmt\n=\nNone\n)\n\n\nT\n.\ntext\n(\nnode\n,\n \nfmt\n=\nNone\n,\n \ndescend\n=\nFalse\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nGives the text that corresponds to a bunch of nodes.\nnodes\nnodes\n can be an arbitrary iterable of nodes.\nNo attempt will be made to sort the nodes.\nIf you need order, it is\nbetter to order the nodes before you feed them to \nT.text()\n.\nfmt\nThe format of text-representation is given with \nfmt\n, with default \ntext-orig-full\n.\nIf the \nfmt\n\ncannot be found, the default is taken.\nThe default is \ntext-orig-full\n if the first argument is an iterable of \nnodes\n.\nThe default is \nnodetype\n-default\n if the first argument is a single \nnode\n with type \nnodetype\n.\nIf the default format is not defined in the\n\notext\n feature of the dataset,\nwhat will happen is dependent on the first argument, \nnodes\n or \nnode\n.\nIf the argument is an iterable of \nnodes\n, for each node its node type and node number\nwill be output, connected with a \n_\n .\nIf the argument is a single \nnode\n, Text-Fabric will look up de slot nodes contained in it\n(by means of \nL.d(node, otype=slotType)\n and format them with \ntext-orig-full\n.\nIf the format \nis\n defined, and the first argument is a single \nnode\n, \nText-Fabric will apply that format to the node itself, not to the slots contained in that node.\nBut you can override that by means of \ndescend=True\n. In that case, regardless of the format,\nthe \nnode\n will be replaced by the slot nodes contained in it, before applying the format.\nThe default is sensible\nConsider the simplest call to this function: \nT.text(node)\n.\nThis will apply the default format to \nnode\n. If \nnode\n is non-slot, then in most cases\nthe default format will be applied to the slots contained in \nnode\n.\nBut for special node types, where the best representation is not obtained by descending down\nto the contained slot nodes, the dataset may define special default types that use other\nfeatures to furnish a decent representation.\nBHSA\nIn the BHSA case this happens for the type of lexemes: \nlex\n. Lexemes contain their occurrences\nas slots, but the representation of a lexeme is not the string of its occurrences, but\nresides in a feature such as \nvoc_lex_utf8\n (vocalized lexeme in Unicode).\nThe BHSA dataset defines the format \nlex-default={voc_lex_utf8}\n and this is the only thing\nneeded to regulate the representation of a lexeme.\nHence, \nT.text(lx)\n results in the vocalized lexeme representation of \nlx\n.\nBut if you really want to print out all occurrences of lexeme \nlx\n, you can say\n\nT.text(lx, descend=True)\n.\nBeware of this, however:\nT.text(phr)\n prints the full text of \nphr\n if \nphr\n is a phrase node.\nT.text(phr, fmt='text-orig-full')\n prints the empty string. Why?\nT.text(phr, fmt='text-orig-full', descend=True)\n prints the full text of the phrase.\nIn the first case there is no \nfmt\n argument, so the default is taken,\nwhich would be \nphrase-default\n. But this format does not exists, so Text-Fabric\ndescends to the words of the phrase and applies \ntext-orig-full\n to them.\nIn the second case, there is a \nfmt\n argument, so Text-Fabric applies that \nto the \nnode\n. But \ntext-orig-full\n uses features that have values on words,\nnot on phrases.\nThe third case is what you probably wanted, and this is what you need if you \nwant to print the phrase in non-default formats:\nT.text(phr, fmt='text-phono-full', descend=True)\nNo error messages\nThis function does not give error messages, because that could easily overwhelm\nthe output stream, especially in a notebook.\nNon slot nodes allowed\nIn most cases, the nodes fed to \nT.text()\n are slots, and the formats are\ntemplates that use features that are defined for slots.\nBut nothing prevents you to define a format for non-slot nodes, and use features\ndefined for a non-slot node type.\nIf, for example, your slot type is \nglyph\n, and you want a format that renders\nlexemes, which are not defined for glyphs but for words, you can just define a\nformat in terms of word features.\nIt is your responsibility to take care to use the formats for node types for\nwhich they make sense.\nEscape whitespace in formats\nWhen defining formats in \notext.tf\n, if you need a newline or tab in the format,\nspecify it as \n\\n\n and \n\\t\n.\nSearching\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhat is Text-Fabric Search?\nYou can query for graph like structures in your data set. The structure you are\ninterested in has to be written as a \nsearch template\n, offered to \nS.search()\n\nwhich returns the matching results as tuples of nodes.\nA search template expresses a pattern of nodes and edges with additional conditions\nalso known as \nquantifiers\n.\nA result of a search template is a tuple of nodes that instantiate the nodes in\nthe pattern, in such a way that the edges of the pattern are also instantiated\nbetween the nodes of the result tuple.\nMoreover, the quantifiers will hold for each result tuple.\nS\nThe Search API is exposed as \nS\n or \nSearch\n.\nSearch templates\n\u00b6\n\n\nSearch primer\nA search template consists of a bunch of lines, possibly indented, that specify\nobjects to look for. Here is a simple example:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n\n\n\n\n\nThis template looks for word combinations within a sentence within chapter 2 of\neither Genesis or Exodus, where one of the words is a verb and the other is a\nnoun. Both have a feminine inflection, but the verb is plural and the noun is\nsingular.\nThe indentation signifies embedding, i.e. containment. The two words are\ncontained in the same sentence, the sentence is contained in the chapter, the\nchapter in the book.\nThe conditions you specify on book, chapter, word are all conditions in terms of\n\nnode features\n. You can use all features in the corpus for\nthis.\nThe order of the two words is immaterial. If there are cases where the verb\nfollows the noun, they will be included in the results.\nAlso, the words do not have to be adjacent. If there are cases with words\nintervening between the noun and the verb, they will be included in the results.\nSpeaking of results: the \nS.search()\n function returns its results as tuples of\nnodes:\n1\n(\nbook\n,\n \nchapter\n,\n \nsentence\n,\n \nword1\n,\n \nword2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these nodes in hand, you can programmatically gather all information about\nthe results that the corpus provides.\nIf the order between the verb and the noun is important, you can specify that as\nan additional constraint. You can give the words a name, and state a relational\ncondition. Here we state that the noun precedes the verb.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        vb:word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        nn:word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\nnn < vb\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be written a bit more economically as:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        > word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you insist that the noun immediately precedes the verb, you can use a\ndifferent relational operator:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        :> word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more kinds of relational operators.\nIf the noun must be the first word in the sentence, you can specify it as\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      s:sentence\n        w:word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n        <: word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\ns =: w\n\n\n\n\n\nor a bit more economically:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        =: word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n        <: word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the verb must be the last word in the sentence, you can specify it as\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      s:sentence\n        word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n        <: w:word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\ns := w\n\n\n\n\n\nor a bit more economically:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      s:sentence\n        word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n        <: word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        :=\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the \nedge features\n in the corpus as\nrelational operators as well.\nSuppose we have an edge feature \nsub\n between clauses, such that if main clause\n\nm\n has subordinate clauses \ns1\n, \ns2\n and \ns3\n, then\n1\nE.sub.f(m) = (s1, s2, s3)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use this relation in search. Suppose we want to find the noun verb pair\nin subordinate clauses only. We can use this template:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      m:clause\n        s:clause\n          word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n          :> word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\nm -sub> s\n\n\n\n\n\nor a bit more economically:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nbook name=Genesis|Exodus\n  chapter number=2\n    clause\n      -sub> clause\n        word    pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        :> word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n\n\n\n\n\nRead \nm -sub> s\n as: there is a \nsub\n-arrow from \nm\n to \ns\n.\nEdge features may have values.\nFor example, the\n\ncrossref feature\n\nis a set of edges between parallel verses, with the levels of confidence\nas values. This number is an integer between 0 and 100.\nWe can ask for parallel verses in an unqualified way:\n1\n2\nverse\n-crossref> verse\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we can also ask for the cases with a specific confidence:\n1\n2\nverse\n-crossref=90> verse\n\n\n\n\n\nor cases with a high confidence:\n1\n2\nverse\n-crossref>95> verse\n\n\n\n\n\nor cases with a low confidence:\n1\n2\nverse\n-crossref<80> verse\n\n\n\n\n\nAll feature conditions that you can assert on node features, you can also\nassert for edge features. If an edge feature is integer valued, such as \ncrossref\n\nyou can use comparisons; if it is string valued, you can use regular expressions.\nIn both cases you can also use the other constructs, such as\n1\n2\nverse\n-crossref=66|77> verse\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get a more specific introduction to search, consult the search tutorials for\n\nHebrew\n,\n\nPeshitta\n,\n\nSyrNT\n,\nand\n\nCuneiform\n.\nFinally an example with quantifiers. We want all clauses where Pred-phrases\nconsist of verbs only:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n  clause\n  /where/\n    phrase function=Pred\n  /have/\n    /without/\n      word sp#verb\n    /-/\n  /-/\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch template reference\nWe have these kinds of lines in a template:\ncomment\n lines\nif a line starts with \n#\n it is a comment line`;\nyou cannot comment out parts of lines, only whole lines;\nif a line is empty or has whitespace only, it is a comment line;\ncomment lines are allowed everywhere;\ncomment lines are ignored.\natom\n lines\n(simple): \nindent name:otype-or-set features\nExamples\nword pos=verb gender=feminine\nvb:word pos=verb gender=feminine\nvb pos=verb gender=feminine\nThe indent is significant. Indent is counted as the number of white space\n    characters, where tabs count for just 1. \nAvoid tabs!\n.\nThe \nname:\n part is optional.\n    If present, it defines a name for this atom that can be used\n    in relational comparisons and other atoms.\nThe \notype-or-set\n part is optional.\n    If it is absent, the \nname\n part must be present.\n    The meaning of\n1\n2\np:phrase sp=verb\np vs=qal\n\n\n\n\n\nis identical to the meaning of\n1\n2\n3\np:phrase sp=verb\npnew:phrase vs=qal\np = pnew\n\n\n\n\n\n(with relop): \nindent op name:otype-or-set features\n<: word pos=verb gender=feminine\nThe relation operator specifies an extra constraint between a preceding atom\n    and this atom.\nThe preceding atom may be the parent, provided we are at its first child, or\n    it may the preceding sibling.\nYou can leave out the \nname:otype-or-set features\n bit. In that case, the\n    relation holds between the preceding atom and its parent.\nThe \nname:\n part is optional. Exactly as in the case without relop.\nThe \notype-or-set\n part is optional. Exactly as in the case without relop.\nThe otype-or-set is either a node type that exists in your TF data set,\nor it is the name of a set that you have passed in the \nsets\n parameter alongside\nthe query itself when you call \nS.search()\n or \nS.study()\n.\nSee \nfeature specifications\n below for all\nfull variety of feature constraints on nodes and edges.\nfeature\n lines: \nfeatures\nIndent is not significant. Continuation of feature constraints after a\n    preceding atom line or other feature line.

This specification must be written as a white-space separated list\nof \nfeature specs\n.\nA \nfeature spec\n has the form \nname\n \nvalueSpec\n, with no space between the \nname\n\nand the \nvalueSpec\n.\nThe \nvalueSpec\n may have the following forms and meanings:\nform\nevaluates to \nTrue\n the feature \nname\n ...\nhas any value except \nNone\n#\nhas value \nNone\n*\nhas arbitrary value\n=\nvalues\nhas one of the values specified\n#\nvalues\nhas none of the values specified\n>\nvalue\nis greater than \nvalue\n<\nvalue\nis less than \nvalue\n~\nregular expression\nhas a value and it matches \nregular expression\nWhy \n*\n ?\nThe operator \n*\n after a feature name does not pose any restriction at all.\nIt will not influence the search results.\nWhy would you want to include such a \"criterion\"?\nSome applications, such as the Text-Fabric browser collect the features used in a query\nto retrieve result information to be presented to the user. So if you want to include\nthe values of a particular feature, mention that feature with a \n*\n.\nAll these forms are also valid as \n-\nname\n \nform\n>\n and \n<\nname\n \nform\n-\n, in which case\nthey specify value constraints on edge features.\nThis is only meaningful if the edge feature is declared to have values (most edge features\ndo not have values).\nAdditional constraints\nThere may be no space around the \n=#<>~\n.\nname\n must be a feature name that exists in the dataset. If it references a\n    feature that is not yet loaded, the feature will be loaded automatically.\nvalues\n must be a \n|\n separated list of feature values, no quotes. No spaces\n    around the \n|\n. If you need a space or \n|\n or \n\\\n in a value, escape it by a\n    \n\\\n.

None of the atoms in a template of a quantifier corresponds to\na node in a final result tuple.\nMay be nested\nTemplates within a quantifier may contain other quantifiers.\nThe idea is, that whenever a search template is evaluated, quantifiers at the outer level of \nget interpreted.\nThis interpretation gives rise to one or more templates to be constructed and run.\nThose new templates have been stripped of the outer layer of quantifiers,\nand when these templates are executed, the quantifiers at the next level have become outer.\nAnd so on.\nRestrictions\nDue to the implementation of quantifiers there are certain restrictions.\nQuantifiers must be put immediately below their parents or below\n    preceding quantifiers of the same parent.\nThe keywords of a quantifier must appear on lines with exactly the same indentation\n    as the atom they quantify.\nThe templates of a quantifier must have equal or greater indent than its keywords;\nThe names accessible to the templates inside a quantifier are:\nthe name \n..\n, which is the name of the atom that is quantified;\n    this name is automagically valid in quantifier templates;\nthe name of the atom that is quantified (if that atom has a given name);\nnames defined in the template itself;\nin \n/where/\n, \ntemplateH\n may use names defined in \ntemplateA\n;\n    but only if these names are defined outside any quantifier of\n    \ntemplateA\n.\nThe following situations block the visibility of names:\nin \n/with/\n, \ntemplateO\ni\n may not use names defined in \ntemplateO\nj\n for \nj\n other than \ni\n;\nnames defined outer quantifiers are not accessible in inner quantifiers;\nnames defined inner quantifiers are not accessible in outer quantifiers.\nWhen you nest quantifiers, think of the way they will be recomposed into\nordinary templates. This dictates whether your quantifier is syntactically valid or not.\nIndentation\nThe indentation in quantifiers relative to their parent atom will be preserved.\nNested quantifiers\nConsider\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nclause\n/where/\n  phrase function=Pred\n/have/\n  /without/\n    word sp#verb\n  /-/\n/-/\n  phrase function=Subj\n\n\n\n\n\nThe auxiliary templates that will be run are:\nFor the outer quantifier:\n1\n2\nclause\n  phrase function=Pred\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nclause\n  phrase function=Pred\n  /without/\n    word sp#verb\n  /-/\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the inner quantifier:\n1\n2\nphrase function=Pred\n  word sp#verb\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the auxiliary template for the inner quantifier\nis shifted in its entirety to the left, but that the \nrelative indentation is exactly as it shows in the original template.\nImplementation\nHere is a description of the implementation of the quantifiers.\nIt is not the real implementation, but it makes clear what is going on, and why\nthe quantifiers have certain limitations, and how indentation works.\nThe basic idea is:\na quantifier leads to the execution of one or more separate searche templates;\nthe results of these searches are combined by means of set operations:\n    \ndifference\n, \nintersection\n, \nunion\n, dependent on the nature of the quantifier;\nthe end result of this combination will fed as a custom set to the original template after\n    stripping the whole quantifier from that template.\n    So we replace a quantifier by a custom set.\nSuppose we have\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nclause typ=Wx0\nQUANTIFIER1\nQUANTIFIER2\n...\nQUANTIFIERn\n  rest-of-template\n\n\n\n\n\nWe compute a set of clauses \nfilteredClauses1\n based on \n1\n2\nclause typ=Wx0\nQUANTIFIER1\n\n\n\n\n\nand then compute a new set \nfilteredClauses2\n based on\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nS.search('''\nfclause typ=Wx0\nQUANTIFIER2\n''',\n    customSets=dict(fclause=filteredClauses1)\n\n\n\n\n\nand so on until we have had QUANTIFIERn,\nleading to a set \nfilteredClausesN\n of clauses\nthat pass all filters set by the quantifiers.\nFinally, we deliver the results of\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nS.search('''\nfclause\n  rest-of-template\n''',\n    customSets=dict(fclause=filteredClausesN)\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch API\n\u00b6\n\n\nS.relationsLegend()\n1\nS\n.\nrelationsLegend\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nGives dynamic help about the basic relations that you can use in your search\ntemplate.

These sets should be sets of nodes (integers!), and\nthese dictionaries should have nodes as keys and strings or numbers as values.\nmetadata\nEvery feature will receive metadata from \nmetaData\n, which is a dictionary\nmapping a feature name to its metadata.\nvalue types\nThe type of the values should conform to \n@valueType\n (\nint\n or \nstr\n), which\nmust be stated in the metadata.\nedge values\nIf you save an edge feature, and there are values in that edge feature, you have\nto say so, by specifying \nedgeValues = True\n in the metadata for that feature.\ngeneric metadata\nmetaData\n may also contain fields under\n  the empty name. These fields will be added to all features in \nnodeFeatures\n and\n  \nedgeFeatures\n.\nconfig features\nIf you need to write the \nconfig\n feature \notext\n,\nwhich is a metadata-only feature, just\nadd the metadata under key \notext\n in \nmetaData\n and make sure\nthat \notext\n is not a key in \nnodeFeatures\n nor in\n\nedgeFeatures\n.\nThese fields will be written into the separate config feature \notext\n,\nwith no data associated.\nsave location\nThe (meta)data will be written to the very last module in the list of locations\nthat you specified when calling \nFabric()\n or to what you passed as \nmodule\n in\nthe same location. If that module does not exist, it will be created in the last\n\nlocation\n. If both \nlocations\n and \nmodules\n are empty, writing will take place\nin the current directory.\nClearing the cache\n\u00b6\n\n\nTF.clearCache()\n1\nTF\n.\nclearCache\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nText-Fabric precomputes data for you, so that it can be loaded faster. If the\noriginal data is updated, Text-Fabric detects it, and will recompute that data.\nBut there are cases, when the algorithms of Text-Fabric have changed, without\nany changes in the data, where you might want to clear the cache of precomputed\nresults.\nCalling this function just does it, and it is equivalent with manually removing\nall \n.tfx\n files inside the hidden \n.tf\n directory inside your dataset.\nNo need to load\nIt is not needed to execute a \nTF.load()\n first.\nMQL\n\u00b6\n\n\nData interchange with MQL\nYou can interchange with MQL data. Text-Fabric can read and write MQL dumps. An\nMQL dump is a text file, like an SQL dump. It contains the instructions to\ncreate and fill a complete database.\nTF.exportMQL()\n1\nTF\n.\nexportMQL\n(\ndbName\n,\n \ndirName\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nExports the complete TF dataset into single MQL database.\ndirName, dbName\nThe exported file will be written to \ndirName/dbName.mql\n. If \ndirName\n starts\nwith \n~\n, the \n~\n will be expanded to your home directory. Likewise, \n..\n will\nbe expanded to the parent of the current directory, and \n.\n to the current\ndirectory, both only at the start of \ndirName\n.\nCorrespondence TF and MQL\nThe resulting MQL database has the following properties with respect to the\nText-Fabric dataset it comes from:\nthe TF \nslots\n correspond exactly with the MQL \nmonads\n and have the same\n    numbers; provided the monad numbers in the MQL dump are consecutive. In MQL\n    this is not obligatory. Even if there gaps in the monads sequence, we will\n    fill the holes during conversion, so the slots are tightly consecutive;\nthe TF \nnodes\n correspond exactly with the MQL \nobjects\n and have the same\n    numbers\nNode features in MQL\nThe values of TF features are of two types, \nint\n and \nstr\n, and they translate\nto corresponding MQL types \ninteger\n and \nstring\n. The actual values do not\nundergo any transformation.\nThat means that in MQL queries, you use quotes if the feature is a string feature.\nOnly if the feature is a number feature, you may omit the quotes:\n1\n2\n[word sp='verb']\n[verse chapter=1 and verse=1]\n\n\n\n\n\nEnumeration types\nIt is attractive to use eumeration types for the values of a feature, whereever\npossible, because then you can query those features in MQL with \nIN\n and without\nquotes:\n1\n[chapter book IN (Genesis, Exodus)]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will generate enumerations for eligible features.\nInteger values can already be queried like this, even if they are not part of an\nenumeration. So we restrict ourselves to node features with string values. We\nput the following extra restrictions:\nthe number of distinct values is less than 1000\nall values must be legal C names, in practice: starting with a letter,\n    followed by letters, digits, or \n_\n. The letters can only be plain ASCII\n    letters, uppercase and lowercase.\nFeatures that comply with these restrictions will get an enumeration type.\nCurrently, we provide no ways to configure this in more detail.\nMerged enumeration types\nInstead of creating separate enumeration types for individual features,\nwe collect all enumerated values for all those features into one\nbig enumeration type.\nThe reason is that MQL considers equal values in different types as\ndistinct values. If we had separate types, we could never compare\nvalues for different features.\nValues of edge features are ignored\nThere is no place for edge values in\nMQL. There is only one concept of feature in MQL: object features,\nwhich are node features.\nBut TF edges without values can be seen as node features: nodes are\nmapped onto sets of nodes to which the edges go. And that notion is supported by\nMQL:\nedge features are translated into MQL features of type \nLIST OF id_d\n,\ni.e. lists of object identifiers.\nLegal names in MQL\nMQL names for databases, object types and features must be valid C identifiers\n(yes, the computer language C). The requirements are:\nstart with a letter (ASCII, upper-case or lower-case)\nfollow by any sequence of ASCII upper/lower-case letters or digits or\n    underscores (\n_\n)\navoid being a reserved word in the C language\nSo, we have to change names coming from TF if they are invalid in MQL. We do\nthat by replacing illegal characters by \n_\n, and, if the result does not start\nwith a letter, we prepend an \nx\n. We do not check whether the name is a reserved\nC word.\nWith these provisos:\nthe given \ndbName\n correspond to the MQL \ndatabase name\nthe TF \notypes\n correspond to the MQL \nobjects\nthe TF \nfeatures\n correspond to the MQL \nfeatures\nFile size\nThe MQL export is usually quite massive (500 MB for the Hebrew Bible).\nIt can be compressed greatly, especially by the program \nbzip2\n.\nExisiting database\nIf you try to import an MQL file in Emdros, and there exists already a file or\ndirectory with the same name as the MQL database, your import will fail\nspectacularly. So do not do that. A good way to prevent it is:\nexport the MQL to outside your \ntext-fabric-data\n directory, e.g. to\n    \n~/Downloads\n;\nbefore importing the MQL file, delete the previous copy;\nDelete existing copy\n1\n2\ncd\n ~/Downloads\nrm dataset \n;\n mql -b \n3\n < dataset.mql\n\n\n\n\n\nTF.importMQL()\n1\nTF\n.\nimportMQL\n(\nmqlFile\n,\n \nslotType\n=\nNone\n,\n \notext\n=\nNone\n,\n \nmeta\n=\nNone\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nConverts an MQL database dump to a Text-Fabric dataset.\nDestination directory\nIt is recommended to call this \nimportMQL\n on a TF instance called with\n1\nlocations\n=\ntargetDir\n,\n \nmodules\n=\n''\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen the resulting features will be written in the targetDir.\nIn fact, the rules are exactly the same as for \nTF.save()\n.\nslotType\nYou have to tell which object type in the MQL file acts as the slot type,\nbecause TF cannot see that on its own.\notext\nYou can pass the information about sections and text formats as the parameter\n\notext\n. This info will end up in the \notext.tf\n feature. Pass it as a\ndictionary of keys and values, like so:\n1\n2\n3\n4\notext\n \n=\n \n{\n\n    \n'fmt:text-trans-plain'\n:\n \n'{glyphs}{trailer}'\n,\n\n    \n'sectionFeatures'\n:\n \n'book,chapter,verse'\n,\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeta\nLikewise, you can add a dictionary of keys and values that will added to the\nmetadata of all features.

Most of this data are the features, but there is some extra\ndata needed for the special functions of the WARP features and the L-API.\nNormally, you do not use this data, but since it is there, it might be valuable,\nso we have made it accessible in the \nC\n-api, which we document here.\nCall() aka AllComputeds()\n1\n2\nCall\n()\n\n\nAllComputeds\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\nReturns a sorted list of all usable, loaded computed data names.\nC.levels.data\nDescription\nA sorted list of object types plus basic information about them.\nEach entry in the list has the shape\n1\n    \n(\notype\n,\n \naverageSlots\n,\n \nminNode\n,\n \nmaxNode\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \notype\n is the name of the node type, \naverageSlots\n the average size of\nobjects in this type, measured in slots (usually words). \nminNode\n is the first\nnode of this type, \nmaxNode\n the last, and the nodes of this node type are\nexactly the nodes between these two values (including).\nLevel computation and customization\nAll node types have a level, defined by the average amount of slots object of\nthat type usually occupy. The bigger the average object, the lower the levels.\nBooks have the lowest level, words the highest level.\nHowever, this can be overruled. Suppose you have a node type \nphrase\n and above\nit a node type \ncluster\n, i.e. phrases are contained in clusters, but not vice\nversa. If all phrases are contained in clusters, and some clusters have more\nthan one phrase, the automatic level ranking of node types works out well in\nthis case. But if clusters only have very small phrases, and the big phrases do\nnot occur in clusters, then the algorithm may assign a lower rank to clusters\nthan to phrases.\nIn general, it is too expensive to try to compute the levels in a sophisticated\nway. In order to remedy cases where the algorithm assigns wrong levels, you can\nadd a \n@levels\n key to the \notext\n config feature.

And\nsuppose that we have features, named \nbookHeading\n, \nchapterHeading\n, and\n\nverseHeading\n that give the names or numbers of these.\nCustom names\nNote that the terms \nbook\n, \nchapter\n, \nverse\n are not baked into Text-Fabric.\nIt is the corpus data, especially the \notext\n config feature that\nspells out the names of the sections.\nThen \nC.section.data\n is a tuple of two mappings , let us call them \nchapters\n\nand \nverses\n.\nchapters\n is a mapping, keyed by \nbook\n \nnodes\n, and then by\nby chapter \nheadings\n, giving the corresponding\nchapter \nnode\ns as values.\nverses\n is a mapping, keyed by \nbook\n \nnodes\n, and then\nby chapter \nheadings\n, and then by verse \nheadings\n,\ngiving the corresponding verse \nnode\ns as values.\nSupporting the \nT\n-Api\nThe \nT\n-api is good in mapping nodes unto sections, such as books, chapters,\nverses and back.

Walking nodes Most processing boils down to walking through the nodes by visiting node sets in\na suitable order. Occasionally, during the walk you might want to visit\nembedding or embedded nodes to glean some feature information from them. More ways of walking Later, under  Features  there is another convenient way to walk through\nnodes. canonical order The canonical order is a way to sort the nodes in your corpus in such a way\nthat you can enumerate all nodes in the order you encounter them if you\nwalk through your corpus. Briefly this means: embedder nodes come before the nodes that lie embedded in them; earlier stuff comes before later stuff, if a verse coincides with a sentence, the verse comes before the sentence,\n    because verses generally contain sentences and not the other way round; if two objects are intersecting, but none embeds the other, the one with the\n    smallest slot that does not occur in the other, comes first. first things first, big things first That means, roughly, that you start with a\nbook node (Genesis), then a chapter node (Genesis 1), then a verse node, Genesis\n1:1, then a sentence node, then a clause node, a phrase node, and the first word\nnode. Then follow all word nodes in the first phrase, then the phrase node of\nthe second phrase, followed by the word nodes in that phrase. When ever you\nenter a higher structure, you will first get the node corresponding to that\nstructure, and after that the nodes corresponding to the building blocks of that\nstructure. This concept follows the intuition that slot sets with smaller elements come\nbefore slot set with bigger elements, and embedding slot sets come before\nembedded slot sets. Hence, if you enumerate a set of nodes that happens to\nconstitute a tree hierarchy based on slot set embedding, and you enumerate those\nnodes in the slot set order, you will walk the tree in pre-order. This order is a modification of the one as described in (Doedens 1994, 3.6.3). Doedens, Crist-Jan (1994),  Text Databases. One Database Model and Several\nRetrieval Languages , number 14 in Language and Computers, Editions Rodopi,\nAmsterdam, Netherlands and Atlanta, USA. ISBN: 90-5183-729-1, http://books.google.nl/books?id=9ggOBRz1dO4C . The order as defined by\nDoedens corresponds to walking trees in post-order. For a lot of processing, it is handy to have a the stack of embedding elements\navailable when working with an element. That is the advantage of pre-order over\npost-order. It is very much like SAX parsing in the XML world. sortNodes() 1 sortNodes ( nodeSet )    Description delivers an iterable of nodes as a tuple sorted by the  canonical ordering . nodeSet An iterable of nodes to be sorted. sortKey 1 nodeList   =   sorted ( nodes ,   key = sortKey )    Description A function that provides for each node the key to be used to sort nodes in the\ncanonical ordering. That means that the following two pieces of code do the same\nthing: sortNodes(nodeSet)  and  sorted(nodeSet, key=sortKey) . Sorting tuples of nodes Handy to sort things that are not nodes themselves, but data structures with\nnodes in it, e.g. search results: if  results  is a list of tuples of nodes, we\ncould sort them in canonical order like this: 1 sorted ( nodeSet ,   key = lambda   r :   sortKey ( r [ 0 ]))    otypeRank 1 otypeRank [ 'sentence' ]   \nThe node types are ordered in  C.levels.data , and if you reverse that list, you get\nthe rank of a type by looking at the position in which that type occurs. The  slotType  has otypeRank 0, and the more comprehensive a type is, the higher its rank.",

Both the  L.d(n)  and  L.u(n)  work as follows: L.d(n)  returns nodes such that embedding nodes come before embedded nodes\n    words) L.u(n)  returns nodes such that embedded nodes come before embedding nodes\n    books) N.B.:  Suppose you have node types  verse  and  sentence , and usually a\nverse has multiple sentences, but not vice versa. Then you expect that L.d(verseNode)  will contain sentence nodes, L.d(sentenceNode)  will  not  contain verse nodes. But if there is a verse with exactly one sentence, and both have exactly the\nsame words, then that is a case where: L.d(verseNode)  will contain one sentence node, L.d(sentenceNode)  will contain  one  verse node.",

It loads the features it needs (so you do not have to specify those\nfeatures, unless you want to use them via  F ). And finally, it makes some\nfunctions available by which you can make handy use of that information. Section levels are generic In this documentation, we call the main section level  book , the second level chapter , and the third level  verse . Text-Fabric, however, is completely\nagnostic about how these levels are called. It is prepared to distinguish three\nsection levels, but how they are called, must be configured in the dataset. The\ntask of the  otext  feature is to declare which node type and feature correspond\nwith which section level. Text-Fabric assumes that the first section level may\nhave multilingual headings, but that section levels two and three have single\nlanguage headings (numbers of some kind). String versus number Chapter and verse numbers will be considered to be strings or\nintegers, depending on whether your dataset has declared the corresponding\nfeature  valueType  as  str  or as  int . Conceivably, other works might have chapter and verse numbers\nlike  XIV , '3A', '4.5', and in those cases these numbers are obviously not int s. otext is optional If  otext  is missing, the Text API will not be build. If it exists, but\ndoes not specify sections, that part of the Text API will not be built. Likewise\nfor text representations. levels of node types Usually, Text-Fabric computes the hierarchy of node types correctly, in the\nsense that node types that act as containers have a lower level than node types\nthat act as containees. So books have the lowest level, words the highest. See levels . However, if this level assignment turns out to be wrong for\nyour dataset, you can configure the right order in the  otext  feature, by means\nof a key  levels  with value a comma separated list of levels.

T.nodeFromSection() 1 T . nodeFromSection ( section ,   lang = 'en' )    Description Given a  section  tuple, return the node of it. section section  consists of a book name (in language  lang ),\nand a chapter number and a verse\nnumber (both as strings or number depending on the value type of the\ncorresponding feature).

            "text": "Text formats Text can be represented in multiple ways. We provide a number of formats with\nstructured names. A format name is a string of keywords separated by  - : what - how - fullness - modifier For Hebrew any combination of the follwoing could be useful formats: keyword value meaning what text words as they belong to the text what lex lexemes of the words how orig in the original script (Hebrew, Greek, Syriac) (all Unicode) how trans in (latin) transliteration how phono in phonetic/phonological transcription fullness full complete with accents and all diacritical marks fullness plain with accents and diacritical marks stripped, in Hebrew only the consonants are left modifier ketiv (Hebrew): where there is ketiv/qere, follow ketiv instead of qere (default); The default format is  text-orig-full , we assume that every TF dataset defines\nthis format. TF datasets may also define formats of the form  nodetype -default  where  nodetype  is a valid type\nof node in the dataset. These formats have a special meaning for Text-Fabric. Remember that the formats are defined in the  otext  warp config feature of your\nset, not by Text-Fabric. Freedom of names for formats There is complete freedom of choosing names for text formats.\nThey do not have to complied with the above-mentioned scheme. T.formats 1 T . formats    Description Show the text representation formats that have been defined in your dataset. T.text() 1\n2 T . text ( nodes ,   fmt = None )  T . text ( node ,   fmt = None ,   descend = False )    Description Gives the text that corresponds to a bunch of nodes. nodes nodes  can be an arbitrary iterable of nodes.\nNo attempt will be made to sort the nodes.\nIf you need order, it is\nbetter to order the nodes before you feed them to  T.text() . fmt The format of text-representation is given with  fmt , with default  text-orig-full .\nIf the  fmt \ncannot be found, the default is taken. The default is  text-orig-full  if the first argument is an iterable of  nodes . The default is  nodetype -default  if the first argument is a single  node  with type  nodetype . If the default format is not defined in the otext  feature of the dataset,\nwhat will happen is dependent on the first argument,  nodes  or  node . If the argument is an iterable of  nodes , for each node its node type and node number\nwill be output, connected with a  _  . If the argument is a single  node , Text-Fabric will look up de slot nodes contained in it\n(by means of  L.d(node, otype=slotType)  and format them with  text-orig-full . If the format  is  defined, and the first argument is a single  node , \nText-Fabric will apply that format to the node itself, not to the slots contained in that node. But you can override that by means of  descend=True . In that case, regardless of the format,\nthe  node  will be replaced by the slot nodes contained in it, before applying the format. The default is sensible Consider the simplest call to this function:  T.text(node) .\nThis will apply the default format to  node . If  node  is non-slot, then in most cases\nthe default format will be applied to the slots contained in  node . But for special node types, where the best representation is not obtained by descending down\nto the contained slot nodes, the dataset may define special default types that use other\nfeatures to furnish a decent representation. BHSA In the BHSA case this happens for the type of lexemes:  lex . Lexemes contain their occurrences\nas slots, but the representation of a lexeme is not the string of its occurrences, but\nresides in a feature such as  voc_lex_utf8  (vocalized lexeme in Unicode). The BHSA dataset defines the format  lex-default={voc_lex_utf8}  and this is the only thing\nneeded to regulate the representation of a lexeme. Hence,  T.text(lx)  results in the vocalized lexeme representation of  lx . But if you really want to print out all occurrences of lexeme  lx , you can say T.text(lx, descend=True) . Beware of this, however: T.text(phr)  prints the full text of  phr  if  phr  is a phrase node. T.text(phr, fmt='text-orig-full')  prints the empty string. Why? T.text(phr, fmt='text-orig-full', descend=True)  prints the full text of the phrase. In the first case there is no  fmt  argument, so the default is taken,\nwhich would be  phrase-default . But this format does not exists, so Text-Fabric\ndescends to the words of the phrase and applies  text-orig-full  to them. In the second case, there is a  fmt  argument, so Text-Fabric applies that \nto the  node . But  text-orig-full  uses features that have values on words,\nnot on phrases. The third case is what you probably wanted, and this is what you need if you \nwant to print the phrase in non-default formats: T.text(phr, fmt='text-phono-full', descend=True) No error messages This function does not give error messages, because that could easily overwhelm\nthe output stream, especially in a notebook. Non slot nodes allowed In most cases, the nodes fed to  T.text()  are slots, and the formats are\ntemplates that use features that are defined for slots. But nothing prevents you to define a format for non-slot nodes, and use features\ndefined for a non-slot node type. If, for example, your slot type is  glyph , and you want a format that renders\nlexemes, which are not defined for glyphs but for words, you can just define a\nformat in terms of word features. It is your responsibility to take care to use the formats for node types for\nwhich they make sense. Escape whitespace in formats When defining formats in  otext.tf , if you need a newline or tab in the format,\nspecify it as  \\n  and  \\t .",

            "location": "/Api/General/#search-templates",
            "text": "Search primer A search template consists of a bunch of lines, possibly indented, that specify\nobjects to look for. Here is a simple example: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular   This template looks for word combinations within a sentence within chapter 2 of\neither Genesis or Exodus, where one of the words is a verb and the other is a\nnoun. Both have a feminine inflection, but the verb is plural and the noun is\nsingular. The indentation signifies embedding, i.e. containment. The two words are\ncontained in the same sentence, the sentence is contained in the chapter, the\nchapter in the book. The conditions you specify on book, chapter, word are all conditions in terms of node features . You can use all features in the corpus for\nthis. The order of the two words is immaterial. If there are cases where the verb\nfollows the noun, they will be included in the results. Also, the words do not have to be adjacent. If there are cases with words\nintervening between the noun and the verb, they will be included in the results. Speaking of results: the  S.search()  function returns its results as tuples of\nnodes: 1 ( book ,   chapter ,   sentence ,   word1 ,   word2 )    With these nodes in hand, you can programmatically gather all information about\nthe results that the corpus provides. If the order between the verb and the noun is important, you can specify that as\nan additional constraint. You can give the words a name, and state a relational\ncondition. Here we state that the noun precedes the verb. 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        vb:word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        nn:word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\nnn < vb   This can be written a bit more economically as: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        > word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular   If you insist that the noun immediately precedes the verb, you can use a\ndifferent relational operator: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        :> word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular   There are more kinds of relational operators. If the noun must be the first word in the sentence, you can specify it as 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      s:sentence\n        w:word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n        <: word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\ns =: w   or a bit more economically: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      sentence\n        =: word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n        <: word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural   If the verb must be the last word in the sentence, you can specify it as 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      s:sentence\n        word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n        <: w:word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\ns := w   or a bit more economically: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      s:sentence\n        word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\n        <: word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        :=   You can also use the  edge features  in the corpus as\nrelational operators as well. Suppose we have an edge feature  sub  between clauses, such that if main clause m  has subordinate clauses  s1 ,  s2  and  s3 , then 1 E.sub.f(m) = (s1, s2, s3)   You can use this relation in search. Suppose we want to find the noun verb pair\nin subordinate clauses only. We can use this template: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n   chapter number=2\n      m:clause\n        s:clause\n          word pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n          :> word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular\nm -sub> s   or a bit more economically: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 book name=Genesis|Exodus\n  chapter number=2\n    clause\n      -sub> clause\n        word    pos=verb gender=feminine number=plural\n        :> word pos=noun gender=feminine number=singular   Read  m -sub> s  as: there is a  sub -arrow from  m  to  s . Edge features may have values.\nFor example, the crossref feature \nis a set of edges between parallel verses, with the levels of confidence\nas values. This number is an integer between 0 and 100.\nWe can ask for parallel verses in an unqualified way: 1\n2 verse\n-crossref> verse   But we can also ask for the cases with a specific confidence: 1\n2 verse\n-crossref=90> verse   or cases with a high confidence: 1\n2 verse\n-crossref>95> verse   or cases with a low confidence: 1\n2 verse\n-crossref<80> verse   All feature conditions that you can assert on node features, you can also\nassert for edge features. If an edge feature is integer valued, such as  crossref \nyou can use comparisons; if it is string valued, you can use regular expressions.\nIn both cases you can also use the other constructs, such as 1\n2 verse\n-crossref=66|77> verse   To get a more specific introduction to search, consult the search tutorials for Hebrew , Peshitta , SyrNT ,\nand Cuneiform . Finally an example with quantifiers. We want all clauses where Pred-phrases\nconsist of verbs only: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8   clause\n  /where/\n    phrase function=Pred\n  /have/\n    /without/\n      word sp#verb\n    /-/\n  /-/   Search template reference We have these kinds of lines in a template: comment  lines if a line starts with  #  it is a comment line`; you cannot comment out parts of lines, only whole lines; if a line is empty or has whitespace only, it is a comment line; comment lines are allowed everywhere; comment lines are ignored. atom  lines (simple):  indent name:otype-or-set features Examples word pos=verb gender=feminine vb:word pos=verb gender=feminine vb pos=verb gender=feminine The indent is significant. Indent is counted as the number of white space\n    characters, where tabs count for just 1.  Avoid tabs! . The  name:  part is optional.\n    If present, it defines a name for this atom that can be used\n    in relational comparisons and other atoms. The  otype-or-set  part is optional.\n    If it is absent, the  name  part must be present.\n    The meaning of 1\n2 p:phrase sp=verb\np vs=qal   is identical to the meaning of 1\n2\n3 p:phrase sp=verb\npnew:phrase vs=qal\np = pnew   (with relop):  indent op name:otype-or-set features <: word pos=verb gender=feminine The relation operator specifies an extra constraint between a preceding atom\n    and this atom. The preceding atom may be the parent, provided we are at its first child, or\n    it may the preceding sibling. You can leave out the  name:otype-or-set features  bit. In that case, the\n    relation holds between the preceding atom and its parent. The  name:  part is optional. Exactly as in the case without relop. The  otype-or-set  part is optional. Exactly as in the case without relop. The otype-or-set is either a node type that exists in your TF data set,\nor it is the name of a set that you have passed in the  sets  parameter alongside\nthe query itself when you call  S.search()  or  S.study() . See  feature specifications  below for all\nfull variety of feature constraints on nodes and edges. feature  lines:  features Indent is not significant. Continuation of feature constraints after a\n    preceding atom line or other feature line. This way you can divide lengthy\n    feature constraints over multiple lines. See  feature specifications  below for the\nfull variety of feature constraints on nodes and edges. relation  lines:  name operator name s := w m -sub> s m <sub- s Indents and spacing are ignored.

A quantifier  quantifies  its parent atom. /without/ Syntax: 1\n2\n3\n4 atom\n/without/\ntemplateN\n/-/   Meaning: node  r  is a result of this template if and only if  r  is a result of  atom  and\nthere is no tuple  RN  such that ( r ,  RN ) is a result of 1\n2 atom\ntemplateN   /where/ Syntax: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 atom\n/where/\ntemplateA\n/have/\ntemplateH\n/-/   Meaning: node  r  is a result of this template if and only if  r  is a result of  atom  and\nfor all tuples ( RA ) such that ( r ,  RA ) is a result of 1\n2 atom\ntemplateA   there is a tuple  RH  such that ( r ,  RA ,  RH )  is a result of 1\n2\n3 atom\ntemplateA\ntemplateH   /with/ Syntax: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 atom\n/with/\ntemplateO1\n/or/\ntemplateO2\n/or/\ntemplateO3\n/-/   Meaning: node  r  is a result of this template if and only if:\nthere is a tuple  R1  such that ( r ,  R1 ) is a result of 1\n2 atom\ntemplateO1   or there is a tuple  R2  such that ( r ,  R2 ) is a result of 1\n2 atom\ntemplateO2   or there is a tuple  R3  such that ( r ,  R3 ) is a result of 1\n2 atom\ntemplateO3   1 or more alternatives This quantifier can be used with any number of  /or/  keywords, including\nnone at all. If there is no  /or/ , there is just one alternative.\nThe only difference between 1\n2\n3\n4 atom\n/with/\ntemplate\n/-/   and 1\n2 atom\ntemplate   is that the results of the first query contain tuples with only one\nelement, corresponding to the  atom .\nThe second query contains tuples of which the first element\ncorresponds to the  atom , and the remaining members correspond to\nthe  template . Parent The  atom  bit is an atom line, it acts as the  parent  of the quantifier.\nInside a quantifier, you may refer to the parent by the special name  .. .\nSo you do not have to give a name to the parent. Multiple quantifiers You may have multiple quantifiers for one parent. Not in result tuples Whereas a the search for a normal template\nproceeds by finding a tuples that instantiates all it nodes\nin such a way that all relationships expressed in the template hold, a quantifier template\nis not instantiated.\nIt asserts a condition that has to be tested for all nodes relative\nits parent. None of the atoms in a template of a quantifier corresponds to\na node in a final result tuple. May be nested Templates within a quantifier may contain other quantifiers.\nThe idea is, that whenever a search template is evaluated, quantifiers at the outer level of \nget interpreted.\nThis interpretation gives rise to one or more templates to be constructed and run.\nThose new templates have been stripped of the outer layer of quantifiers,\nand when these templates are executed, the quantifiers at the next level have become outer.\nAnd so on. Restrictions Due to the implementation of quantifiers there are certain restrictions. Quantifiers must be put immediately below their parents or below\n    preceding quantifiers of the same parent. The keywords of a quantifier must appear on lines with exactly the same indentation\n    as the atom they quantify. The templates of a quantifier must have equal or greater indent than its keywords; The names accessible to the templates inside a quantifier are: the name  .. , which is the name of the atom that is quantified;\n    this name is automagically valid in quantifier templates; the name of the atom that is quantified (if that atom has a given name); names defined in the template itself; in  /where/ ,  templateH  may use names defined in  templateA ;\n    but only if these names are defined outside any quantifier of\n     templateA . The following situations block the visibility of names: in  /with/ ,  templateO i  may not use names defined in  templateO j  for  j  other than  i ; names defined outer quantifiers are not accessible in inner quantifiers; names defined inner quantifiers are not accessible in outer quantifiers. When you nest quantifiers, think of the way they will be recomposed into\nordinary templates. This dictates whether your quantifier is syntactically valid or not. Indentation The indentation in quantifiers relative to their parent atom will be preserved. Nested quantifiers Consider 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 clause\n/where/\n  phrase function=Pred\n/have/\n  /without/\n    word sp#verb\n  /-/\n/-/\n  phrase function=Subj   The auxiliary templates that will be run are: For the outer quantifier: 1\n2 clause\n  phrase function=Pred   and 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 clause\n  phrase function=Pred\n  /without/\n    word sp#verb\n  /-/   For the inner quantifier: 1\n2 phrase function=Pred\n  word sp#verb   Note that the auxiliary template for the inner quantifier\nis shifted in its entirety to the left, but that the \nrelative indentation is exactly as it shows in the original template. Implementation Here is a description of the implementation of the quantifiers.\nIt is not the real implementation, but it makes clear what is going on, and why\nthe quantifiers have certain limitations, and how indentation works. The basic idea is: a quantifier leads to the execution of one or more separate searche templates; the results of these searches are combined by means of set operations:\n     difference ,  intersection ,  union , dependent on the nature of the quantifier; the end result of this combination will fed as a custom set to the original template after\n    stripping the whole quantifier from that template.\n    So we replace a quantifier by a custom set. Suppose we have 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 clause typ=Wx0\nQUANTIFIER1\nQUANTIFIER2\n...\nQUANTIFIERn\n  rest-of-template   We compute a set of clauses  filteredClauses1  based on  1\n2 clause typ=Wx0\nQUANTIFIER1   and then compute a new set  filteredClauses2  based on 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 S.search('''\nfclause typ=Wx0\nQUANTIFIER2\n''',\n    customSets=dict(fclause=filteredClauses1)   and so on until we have had QUANTIFIERn,\nleading to a set  filteredClausesN  of clauses\nthat pass all filters set by the quantifiers. Finally, we deliver the results of 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 S.search('''\nfclause\n  rest-of-template\n''',\n    customSets=dict(fclause=filteredClausesN)",

TF as Database By means of  S.search(query)  you can use one  TF  instance as a\ndatabase that multiple clients can use without the need for each client to call the \ncostly  load  methods.\nYou have to come up with a process that runs TF, has all features loaded, and\nthat can respond to queries from other processes.\nWe call such a process a  TF kernel . Webservers can use such a daemonized TF to build efficient controllers. A TF kernel and webserver are included in the Text-Fabric code base.\nSee  kernel  and  web . Generator versus tuple If  limit  is specified, the result is not a generator but a tuple of results. More info on the search plan Searching is complex. The search template must be parsed, interpreted, and\ntranslated into a search plan. The following methods expose parts of the search\nprocess, and may provide you with useful information in case the search does not\ndeliver what you expect. see the plan the method  S.showPlan()  below shows you at a glance the correspondence\nbetween the nodes in each result tuple and your search template.

If your query has quantifiers, the asscociated search templates will be constructed\nand executed. These searches will be reported clearly. searchTemplate The search template is a string that conforms to the rules described above. strategy In order to tame the performance of search, the strategy by which results are fetched\nmatters a lot.\nThe search strategy is an implementation detail, but we bring\nit to the surface nevertheless.

Here are a few methods that do actual result fetching.\nThey must be called after a previous  S.search()  or  S.study() . S.count() 1 S . count ( progress = None ,   limit = None )    Description Counts the results, with progress messages, optionally up to a limit. progress Every so often it shows a progress message.\nThe frequency is  progress  results, default every 100. limit Fetch results up to a given  limit , default 1000.\nSetting  limit  to 0 or a negative value means no limit: all results will be\ncounted. why needed You typically need this in cases where result fetching turns out to\nbe (very) slow. generator versus list len(S.results())  does not work, because  S.results()  is a generator\nthat delivers its results as they come. S.fetch() 1 S . fetch ( limit = None )    Description Finally, you can retrieve the results. The result of  fetch()  is not a list of\nall results, but a  generator . It will retrieve results as long as they are\nrequested and their are still results. limit Tries to get that many results and collects them in a tuple.\nSo if limit is not  None , the result is a tuple with a known length. Iterating over the  fetch()  generator You typically fetch results by saying: 1\n2\n3\n4 i   =   0  for   r   in   S . results (): \n     do_something ( r [ 0 ]) \n     do_something_else ( r [ 1 ])    Alternatively, you can set the  limit  parameter, to ask for just so many\nresults. They will be fetched, and when they are all collected, returned as a\ntuple. Fetching a limited amount of results 1 S . fetch ( limit = 10 )    gives you the first bunch of results quickly. S.glean() 1 S . glean ( r )    Description A search result is just a tuple of nodes that correspond to your template, as\nindicated by  showPlan() . Nodes give you access to all information that the\ncorpus has about it. The  glean()  function is here to just give you a first impression quickly.   r Pass a raw result tuple  r , and you get a string indicating where it occurs,\nin terms of sections, \nand what text is associated with the results.

It contains the instructions to\ncreate and fill a complete database. TF.exportMQL() 1 TF . exportMQL ( dbName ,   dirName )    Description Exports the complete TF dataset into single MQL database. dirName, dbName The exported file will be written to  dirName/dbName.mql .

Likewise,  ..  will\nbe expanded to the parent of the current directory, and  .  to the current\ndirectory, both only at the start of  dirName . Correspondence TF and MQL The resulting MQL database has the following properties with respect to the\nText-Fabric dataset it comes from: the TF  slots  correspond exactly with the MQL  monads  and have the same\n    numbers; provided the monad numbers in the MQL dump are consecutive. In MQL\n    this is not obligatory. Even if there gaps in the monads sequence, we will\n    fill the holes during conversion, so the slots are tightly consecutive; the TF  nodes  correspond exactly with the MQL  objects  and have the same\n    numbers Node features in MQL The values of TF features are of two types,  int  and  str , and they translate\nto corresponding MQL types  integer  and  string . The actual values do not\nundergo any transformation. That means that in MQL queries, you use quotes if the feature is a string feature.\nOnly if the feature is a number feature, you may omit the quotes: 1\n2 [word sp='verb']\n[verse chapter=1 and verse=1]   Enumeration types It is attractive to use eumeration types for the values of a feature, whereever\npossible, because then you can query those features in MQL with  IN  and without\nquotes: 1 [chapter book IN (Genesis, Exodus)]   We will generate enumerations for eligible features. Integer values can already be queried like this, even if they are not part of an\nenumeration. So we restrict ourselves to node features with string values. We\nput the following extra restrictions: the number of distinct values is less than 1000 all values must be legal C names, in practice: starting with a letter,\n    followed by letters, digits, or  _ . The letters can only be plain ASCII\n    letters, uppercase and lowercase. Features that comply with these restrictions will get an enumeration type.\nCurrently, we provide no ways to configure this in more detail. Merged enumeration types Instead of creating separate enumeration types for individual features,\nwe collect all enumerated values for all those features into one\nbig enumeration type. The reason is that MQL considers equal values in different types as\ndistinct values. If we had separate types, we could never compare\nvalues for different features. Values of edge features are ignored There is no place for edge values in\nMQL. There is only one concept of feature in MQL: object features,\nwhich are node features.\nBut TF edges without values can be seen as node features: nodes are\nmapped onto sets of nodes to which the edges go. And that notion is supported by\nMQL:\nedge features are translated into MQL features of type  LIST OF id_d ,\ni.e. lists of object identifiers. Legal names in MQL MQL names for databases, object types and features must be valid C identifiers\n(yes, the computer language C). The requirements are: start with a letter (ASCII, upper-case or lower-case) follow by any sequence of ASCII upper/lower-case letters or digits or\n    underscores ( _ ) avoid being a reserved word in the C language So, we have to change names coming from TF if they are invalid in MQL. We do\nthat by replacing illegal characters by  _ , and, if the result does not start\nwith a letter, we prepend an  x . We do not check whether the name is a reserved\nC word. With these provisos: the given  dbName  correspond to the MQL  database name the TF  otypes  correspond to the MQL  objects the TF  features  correspond to the MQL  features File size The MQL export is usually quite massive (500 MB for the Hebrew Bible).\nIt can be compressed greatly, especially by the program  bzip2 . Exisiting database If you try to import an MQL file in Emdros, and there exists already a file or\ndirectory with the same name as the MQL database, your import will fail\nspectacularly. So do not do that. A good way to prevent it is: export the MQL to outside your  text-fabric-data  directory, e.g. to\n     ~/Downloads ; before importing the MQL file, delete the previous copy; Delete existing copy 1\n2 cd  ~/Downloads\nrm dataset  ;  mql -b  3  < dataset.mql   TF.importMQL() 1 TF . importMQL ( mqlFile ,   slotType = None ,   otext = None ,   meta = None )    Description Converts an MQL database dump to a Text-Fabric dataset. Destination directory It is recommended to call this  importMQL  on a TF instance called with 1 locations = targetDir ,   modules = ''    Then the resulting features will be written in the targetDir. In fact, the rules are exactly the same as for  TF.save() . slotType You have to tell which object type in the MQL file acts as the slot type,\nbecause TF cannot see that on its own. otext You can pass the information about sections and text formats as the parameter otext . This info will end up in the  otext.tf  feature. Pass it as a\ndictionary of keys and values, like so: 1\n2\n3\n4 otext   =   { \n     'fmt:text-trans-plain' :   '{glyphs}{trailer}' , \n     'sectionFeatures' :   'book,chapter,verse' ,  }    meta Likewise, you can add a dictionary of keys and values that will added to the\nmetadata of all features. Handy to add provenance data here: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 meta   =   dict ( \n     dataset = 'DLC' , \n     datasetName = 'Digital Language Corpus' , \n     author = \"That 's me\" ,  )",

            "text": "Pre-computing In order to make the API work, Text-Fabric prepares some data and saves it in\nquick-load format. Most of this data are the features, but there is some extra\ndata needed for the special functions of the WARP features and the L-API. Normally, you do not use this data, but since it is there, it might be valuable,\nso we have made it accessible in the  C -api, which we document here. Call() aka AllComputeds() 1\n2 Call ()  AllComputeds ()    Description Returns a sorted list of all usable, loaded computed data names. C.levels.data Description A sorted list of object types plus basic information about them. Each entry in the list has the shape 1      ( otype ,   averageSlots ,   minNode ,   maxNode )    where  otype  is the name of the node type,  averageSlots  the average size of\nobjects in this type, measured in slots (usually words).  minNode  is the first\nnode of this type,  maxNode  the last, and the nodes of this node type are\nexactly the nodes between these two values (including). Level computation and customization All node types have a level, defined by the average amount of slots object of\nthat type usually occupy. The bigger the average object, the lower the levels.\nBooks have the lowest level, words the highest level. However, this can be overruled. Suppose you have a node type  phrase  and above\nit a node type  cluster , i.e. phrases are contained in clusters, but not vice\nversa. If all phrases are contained in clusters, and some clusters have more\nthan one phrase, the automatic level ranking of node types works out well in\nthis case. But if clusters only have very small phrases, and the big phrases do\nnot occur in clusters, then the algorithm may assign a lower rank to clusters\nthan to phrases. In general, it is too expensive to try to compute the levels in a sophisticated\nway. In order to remedy cases where the algorithm assigns wrong levels, you can\nadd a  @levels  key to the  otext  config feature. See text . C.order.data Description An  array  of all nodes in the correct order. This is the\norder in which  N()  alias  Node()  traverses all nodes. Rationale To order all nodes in the  canonical ordering  is quite a bit of\nwork, and we need this ordering all the time. C.rank.data Description An  array  of all indices of all nodes in the canonical order\narray. It can be viewed as its inverse. Order arbitrary node sets I we want to order a set of nodes in the canonical ordering, we need to know\nwhich position each node takes in the canonical order, in other words, at what\nindex we find it in the  C.order.data  array. C.levUp.data and C.levDown.data Description These tables feed the  L.d()  and  L.u()  functions. Use with care They consist of a fair amount of megabytes, so they are heavily optimized.\nIt is not advisable to use them directly, it is far better to use the  L  functions. Only when every bit of performance waste has to be squeezed out, this raw data\nmight be a deal. C.boundary.data Description These tables feed the  L.n()  and  L.p()  functions.\nIt is a tuple consisting of  firstSlots  and  lastSlots .\nThey are indexes for the first slot\nand last slot of nodes. Slot index For each slot,  firstSlot  gives all nodes (except\nslots) that start at that slot, and  lastSlot  gives all nodes (except slots)\nthat end at that slot.\nBoth  firstSlot  and  lastSlot  are tuples, and the\ninformation for node  n  can be found at position  n-MaxSlot-1 . C.sections.data Description Let us assume for the sake of clarity, that the node type of section level 1 is book , that of level 2 is  chapter , and that of level 3 is  verse . And\nsuppose that we have features, named  bookHeading ,  chapterHeading , and verseHeading  that give the names or numbers of these. Custom names Note that the terms  book ,  chapter ,  verse  are not baked into Text-Fabric.\nIt is the corpus data, especially the  otext  config feature that\nspells out the names of the sections. Then  C.section.data  is a tuple of two mappings , let us call them  chapters \nand  verses . chapters  is a mapping, keyed by  book   nodes , and then by\nby chapter  headings , giving the corresponding\nchapter  node s as values. verses  is a mapping, keyed by  book   nodes , and then\nby chapter  headings , and then by verse  headings ,\ngiving the corresponding verse  node s as values. Supporting the  T -Api The  T -api is good in mapping nodes unto sections, such as books, chapters,\nverses and back. It knows how many chapters each book has, and how many verses\neach chapter. The  T  api is meant to make your life easier when you have to find passage\nlabels by nodes or vice versa. That is why you probably never need to consult\nthe underlying data. But you can!

collected in the\n\napphelpers\n\nmodule of TF.\nGeneric/specific\nSometimes there is an intricate mix of functionality that is shared by all apps and that\nis specific to some app.\nHere is our logistics of functionality.\nThere are a number of methods that are offered as a generic function and\njust added as a method to the \nextraApi\n of the app, e.g. \npretty()\n\nFor example, the Bhsa app imports \npretty\n first:\n1\nfrom\n \ntf.apphelpers\n \nimport\n \npretty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand in the Bhsa \n__init__()\n function it says:\n1\nself\n.\npretty\n \n=\n \ntypes\n.\nMethodType\n(\npretty\n,\n \nself\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich adds the function \npretty\n as an instance method to the class Bhsa.\nThe first argument \nextraApi\n of the function \npretty\n acts as the \nself\n when \n\npretty()\n is used as a method of Bhsa.\nSo although we define \npretty(extraApi, ...)\n as a generic function,\nthrough its argument \nextraApi\n we can call app specific functionality.\nWe follow this pattern for quite a bit of functions.\nThey all have \nextraApi\n as first argument.\nTwo contexts\nMost functions with the \nextraApi\n argument are meant to perform their duty in two contexts:\nwhen called in a Jupyter notebook they deliver output meant for a notebook output cell,\n  using methods provided by the \nipython\n package.\nwhen called by the web app they deliver output meant for the TF browser website,\n  generating raw HTML.\nThe \nextraApi\n is the rich app specific API, and when we construct this API, we pass the information\nwhether it is constructed for the purposes of the Jupyter notebook, or for the purposes of the web app.\nWe pass this information by setting the attribute \nasApi\n on the \nextraApi\n. \nIf it is set, we use the \nextraApi\n in the web app context.\nMost of the code in such functions is independent of \nasApi\n.\nThe main difference is how to output the result: by a call to an IPython display method, or by\nreturning raw HTML.\nTF Data getters\n\u00b6\n\n\nAuto loading of TF data\nThe specific apps have functions to load and download data from github.\nThey check first whether there is local data in a github repository,\nand if not, they check a local text-fabric-data directory,\nand if not, they download data from a know online GitHub repo into the local\ntext-fabric-data directory.\nThe data functions provided take parameters with these meanings:\ndataUrl\nThe complete url from which to download data.\nghBase\nThe location of the local github directory, usually \n~/github\n.\nThis directory is expected to be subdivided by org and then by repo, just as the online\nGitHub.\ndataRel\nThe relative path within the local github/text-fabric-data directory to the directory\nthat holds versions of TF data.\nversion\nThe version of the TF data of interest.\nhasData(dataRel, ghBase, version)\nChecks whether there is TF data in standard locations.\nReturns the full path of the local github directory if the data is found in the expected place below it.\nReturns the full path of the local text-fabric-data directory if the data is found in the expected place below it.\nReturns \nFalse\n if there no offline copy of the data has been found in these locations.\ngetData(dataUrl, dataRel, ghBase, version)\nChecks whether there is TF data in standard locations.\nIf not, downloads data from \ndataUrl\n and places it in \n~/text-fabric-data/dataRel/version\ngetDataCustom(dataUrl, dest)\nRetrieves a zip file from \ndataUrl\n, and unpacks it at directory \ndest\n locally.\nTF search performers\n\u00b6\n\n\nsearch(extraApi, query, silent=False, sets=None, shallow=False)\nThis is a thin wrapper around the generic search interface of TF:\n\nS.search\nThe extra thing it does it collecting the results.\n\nS.search()\n may yield a generator, and this \nsearch()\n makes sure to iterate\nover that generator, collect the results, and return them as a sorted list.\nContext Jupyter\nThe intended context of this function is: an ordinary Python program (including\nthe Jupyter notebook).\nWeb apps can better use \nrunSearch\n below.\nrunSearch(api, query, cache)\nA wrapper around the generic search interface of TF.\nBefore running the TF search, the \nquery\n will be looked up in the \ncache\n.\nIf present, its cached results/error messages will be returned.\nIf not, the query will be run, results/error messages collected, put in the \ncache\n, and returned.\nContext web app\nThe intended context of this function is: web app.\nrunSearchCondensed(api, query, cache, condenseType)\nWhen query results need to be condensed into a container, this function takes care of that.\nIt first tries the \ncache\n for condensed query results.\nIf that fails,\nit collects the bare query results from the cache or by running the query.\nThen it condenses the results, puts them in the \ncache\n, and returns them.\nContext web app\nThe intended context of this function is: web app.\nTabular display\n\u00b6\n\n\ntable(extraApi, tuples, ...)\nTakes a list of \ntuples\n and\ncomposes it into a Markdown table.\nContext Jupyter\nThe intended context of this function is:\nthe Jupyter notebook.\ncompose(extraApi, tuples, start. position, opened, ...)\nTakes a list of \ntuples\n and\ncomposes it into an HTML table.\nSome of the rows will be expandable, namely the rows specified by \nopened\n,\nfor which extra data has been fetched.\nContext web app\nThe intended context of this function is: web app.\nplainTuple(extraApi, tuple)\nDisplays a \ntuple\n of nodes as a table row:\na markdown row in the context Jupyter;\nan HTML row in the context web app.\nPretty display\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhat is pretty?\nNodes are just numbers, but they stand for all the information that the corpus\nhas about a certain item.\n\npretty(node)\n makes a lot of that information visible in an app dependent way.\nFor the Bhsa it means showing nested and intruding sentences, clauses and phrases.\nFor the Cunei tablets it means showing alternating vertical and horizontal\nsubdivisions of faces into columns, lines and cases.\nFor the Peshitta it currently means showing the words of verses in unicode and ETCBC/WIT\ntranscription.\nFor the SyrNT it currently means showing the words of verses in unicode and SEDRA\ntranscription.\nWhen you show a pretty representation of a node,\nusually pretty representations of \"contained\" nodes will also be drawn.\nYou can selectively highlight those nodes with custom colors.\nWhen pretty-displaying a tuple of nodes, container nodes that contain those nodes\nwill be looked up and displayed, and the actual tuple nodes will be highlighted.\nYou can customize the highlight colors by selecting colors on the basis of the\npostions of nodes in their tuples, or you can explicitly pass a micro-managed\ncolormap of nodes to colors.\nIn pretty displays you can opt for showing/hiding the node numbers,\nfor suppressing certain standard features, and there are app dependent options.\nIn the case of Cunei tablets, you can opt to show the lineart of signs and quads,\nand to show the line numbers of the source transcriptions.\nshow(extraApi, tuples, ...)\nTakes a list of \ntuples\n and\ncomposes it into a sequence of pretty displays per tuple.\nContext Jupyter\nThe intended context of this function is:\nthe Jupyter notebook.\nprettyTuple(extraApi, tuple)\nDisplays a \ntuple\n of nodes as an expanded display, both\nin the context Jupyter and\nin the context web app.\npretty(extrApi, node, ...)\nDisplays a single \nnode\n as an expanded display, both\nin the context Jupyter and\nin the context web app.\nprettyPre(extraApi, node, ...)\nHelper for \npretty\n.\nPretty display is pretty complicated.\nThere are large portions of functionality that are generic,\nand large portions that are app specific.\nThis function computes a lot of generic things, based on which\na pretty display can be constructed.\nprettySetup(extraApi, features=None, noneValues=None)\nPretty displays show a chosen set of standard features for nodes.\nBy means of the parameter \nsuppress\n you can leave out certain features.\nBut what if you want to add features to the display?\nThat is what \nprettySetup()\n does.\nIt adds a list of \nfeatures\n to the display, provided they are loadable.\nIf they are not yet loaded, they will be loaded.\nFeatures with values that represent no information, will be suppressed.\nBut you can customise what counts as no information, by passing a set\nof such values as \nnoneValues\n. \nHTML and Markdown\n\u00b6\n\n\ngetBoundary(api, node)\nUtility function to ask from the TF API the first slot and the last slot contained in a node.\ngetFeatures(extraApi, node, ...)\nHelper for \npretty()\n: wrap the requested features and their values for \nnode\n in HTML for pretty display.\ngetContext(api, nodes)\nGet the features and values for a set of \nnodes\n. \nAll loaded features will be retrieved.\nheader(extraApi)\nGet the app-specific links to data and documentation and wrap it into HTML for display in the TF browser.\noutLink(text, href, title=None, ...)\nProduce a formatted HTML link.\nhtmlEsc(val)\nProduce a representation of \nval\n that is safe for usage in a HTML context.\nmdEsc(val)\nProduce a representation of \nval\n that is safe for usage in a Markdown context.\ndm(markdown)\nDisplay a \nmarkdown\n string in a Jupyter notebook.\nConstants\n\u00b6\n\n\nFixed values\nThe following values are used by other parts of the program:\nname\ndescription\nRESULT\nthe label of a query result: \nresult\nGH_BASE\nthe location of the local github directory\nURL_GH\nthe url to the GitHub site\nURL_NB\nthe url to the NBViewer

For the SyrNT it currently means showing the words of verses in unicode and SEDRA\ntranscription. When you show a pretty representation of a node,\nusually pretty representations of \"contained\" nodes will also be drawn. You can selectively highlight those nodes with custom colors. When pretty-displaying a tuple of nodes, container nodes that contain those nodes\nwill be looked up and displayed, and the actual tuple nodes will be highlighted. You can customize the highlight colors by selecting colors on the basis of the\npostions of nodes in their tuples, or you can explicitly pass a micro-managed\ncolormap of nodes to colors. In pretty displays you can opt for showing/hiding the node numbers,\nfor suppressing certain standard features, and there are app dependent options. In the case of Cunei tablets, you can opt to show the lineart of signs and quads,\nand to show the line numbers of the source transcriptions. show(extraApi, tuples, ...)

That is what  prettySetup()  does.\nIt adds a list of  features  to the display, provided they are loadable.\nIf they are not yet loaded, they will be loaded.

None is useful Keep  None  in the set. If not, all custom features will be displayed\nfor all kinds of nodes. So you will see clause types on words,\n  and part of speech on clause atoms, al with value  None .

None is useful Keep  None  in the set. If not, all custom features will be displayed\nfor all kinds of nodes.

The images that show up are clickable\nand link through to an online, higher resolution version on CDLI. Images will\nhave, by default, a caption that links to the relevant page on CDLI. Placement The result will be returned as a  row  of images.\nSubsequent calls to  photo()  and  lineart() \nwill result in vertically stacked rows. nodes nodes  is one or more  nodes .\nAs far as they are of type  tablet ,  quad  or  sign ,\na photo or lineart will be looked up for them. by name Instead of a node you may also\nsupply the P-number of a tablet or the name of the sign or quad. key key  is an optional string specifying which of the available images for\nthis node you want to use. look up if you want to know which keys are available for a\nnode, supply  key='xxx' , or any non-existing key. asLink asLink=True : no image will be placed, only a link to the online\nimage at CDLI.\nIn this case the  caption  will be suppressed, unless\nexplicitly given. withCaption withCaption='bottom'  controls whether a CDLI link to the\ntablet page must be put under the image.\nYou can also specify  top ,  left ,  right .\nIf left out, no caption will be placed. options options  is a series of key=value arguments that\ncontrol the placement of the images,\nsuch as  width=100 ,  height=200 . CSS The optional parameters  height  and  width  control the height and width of the\nimages. The value should be a valid CSS  length, such as 100px ,  10em ,  32vw . If you pass an integer, or a decimal string without\nunit, your value will be converted to that many  px . These parameters are interpreted as setting a maximum value (in fact they will\nend up as  max-width  and  max-height  on the final  <img/>  element in the\nHTML. So if you specify both  width  and  height , the image will be placed in tightly\nin a box of those dimensions without changing the aspect ratio. If you want to force that the width of height you pass is completely consumed,\nyou can prefix your value with a  ! . In that case the aspect ratio maybe\nchanged. You can use the  !  also for both  height  and  width . In that case,\nthe rectangle will be completely filled, and the aspect ratio will be adjusted\nto that of the rectangle. The way the effect of the  !  is achieved, is by adding  min-width  and min-height  properties to the  <img/>  element. local images The images will be called in by a little piece of generated HTML, using the <img/>  tag. This only works if the image is within reach. To the images will\nbe copied to a sister directory of the notebook. The name of this directory is cdli-imagery .

This strategy is called\n\nboxing\n.\nTo the client the shadow object looks like the real thing,\nbut when the client needs to access members, they will be fetched\non the fly.\nThis is a performance problem when the service sends a big list or dict,\nand the client iterates over all its items. Each item will be fetched in\na separate interprocess call, which causes an enormous overhead.\nBoxing only happens for mutable objects. And here lies the work-around:\nThe service must send big chunks of data as immutable objects,\nsuch as tuples. They are sent within a single interprocess call,\nand fly swiftly through the connecting pipe. \nheader()\nCalls the \nheader()\n method of the extraApi,\nwhich fetches all the stuff to create a header\non the page with links to data and documentation of the\ndata source.\nprovenance()\nCalls the \nprovenance()\n method of the extraApi,\nwhich fetches provenance metadata to be shown\non exported pages.\ncss()\nCalls the \nloadCSS()\n method of the extraApi,\nwhich delivers the CSS code to be inserted\non the browser page.\ncondenseTypes()\nFetches several things from the extraApi and the \ngeneric TF api:\ncondenseType\n: the default node type that acts\n  as a container for representing query results;\n  for Bhsa it is \nverse\n, for Cunei it is \ntablet\n;\nexampleSection\n: an example for the help text\n  for this data source;\nlevels\n: information about the node types in this\n  data source.\nsearch()\nThe work horse of this API.\nExecutes a TF search template, retrieves\nformatted results, retrieves \nformatted results for additional nodes and\nsections.\nParameters:\nquery\nSearch template to be executed.\nTypically coming\nfrom the \nsearch pad\n in the browser.\ntuples\nTuples of nodes to look up features for.\nTypically coming\nfrom the \nnode pad\n in the browser.\nsections\nSections to look up features for.\nTypically coming\nfrom the \nsection pad\n in the browser.\nFor the Bhsa these are \nverse\n references,\nfor Cunei these are tablets by \nP-number\n.\ncondensed\nWhether or not the results should be \ncondensed\n.\nNormally, results come as tuples of nodes, and each\ntuple is shown in a corresponding table row in\nplain or pretty display.\nBut you can also \ncondense\n results in container\nobjects. All tuples will be inspected, and the nodes\nof each tuple will be gathered in containers,\nand these containers will be displayed in table rows.\nWhat is lost is the notion of an individual result,\nand what is gained is a better overview of where\nthe parts of the results are.\ncondenseType\nWhen condensing results, you can choose the node type\nthat acts as container.\nNodes get suppressed\nNodes in result tuples that have a type\nthat is bigger than the condenseType, will\nbe skipped.\nE.g. if you have chapter nodes in your results,\nbut you condense to verses, the chapter nodes will \nnot show up.\nBut if you condense to books, they will show up.\nbatch\nThe number of table rows to show on one page\nin the browser.\nposition=1\nThe position that is central in the browser.\nThe navigation links take this position\nas the focus point, and enable the user\nto navigate to neighbouring results, in ever bigger\nstrides.\nopened=set()\nWhich results have been expanded and need extended results.\nNormally, only the information to provide a \nplain\n\nrepresentation of a result is being fetched,\nbut for the opened ones information is gathered for\npretty displays.\nwithNodes=False\nWhether to include the node numbers into the formatted\nresults.\nlinked=1\nWhich column in the results should be hyperlinked to\nonline representations closest to the objects\nin that column.\nCounting columns starts at 1.\noptions\nAdditional keyword arguments are passed\nas options to the underlying API.\nFor example, the Cunei API accepts \nlinenumbers\n\nand \nlineart\n, which will ask to include line numbers\nand lineart in the formatted results.\ncsvs()\nThis is an other workhorse.\nIt also asks for the things \nsearch()\n is asking\nfor, but it does not want formatted results.\nIt will get tabular data of result\nnodes, one for the \nsections\n, one for the \nnode tuples\n,\nand one for the \nsearch results\n.\nFor every node that occurs in this tabular data,\nfeatures will be looked up.\nAll loaded features will be looked up for those nodes.\nThe result is a big table of nodes and feature values.\nThe parameters are \nquery\n, \ntuples\n, \nsections\n,\n\ncondensed\n, \ncondenseType\n and have the same meaning as\nin \nsearch()\n above.",

            "text": "About The API of the TF kernel is created\nby the function  makeTfKernel  in the  data \nmodule of the server subpackage. It returns a class  TfKernel  with a number\nof exposed methods that can be called by other programs. For the machinery of interprocess communication we rely on the rpyc  module.\nSee especially the docs on services . Shadow objects The way rpyc works in the case of data transmission has a pitfall.\nWhen a service returns a Python object to the client, it\ndoes not return the object itself, but only a shadow object\nso called  netref  objects. This strategy is called boxing .\nTo the client the shadow object looks like the real thing,\nbut when the client needs to access members, they will be fetched\non the fly. This is a performance problem when the service sends a big list or dict,\nand the client iterates over all its items. Each item will be fetched in\na separate interprocess call, which causes an enormous overhead. Boxing only happens for mutable objects. And here lies the work-around: The service must send big chunks of data as immutable objects,\nsuch as tuples. They are sent within a single interprocess call,\nand fly swiftly through the connecting pipe.  header() Calls the  header()  method of the extraApi,\nwhich fetches all the stuff to create a header\non the page with links to data and documentation of the\ndata source. provenance() Calls the  provenance()  method of the extraApi,\nwhich fetches provenance metadata to be shown\non exported pages. css() Calls the  loadCSS()  method of the extraApi,\nwhich delivers the CSS code to be inserted\non the browser page. condenseTypes() Fetches several things from the extraApi and the \ngeneric TF api: condenseType : the default node type that acts\n  as a container for representing query results;\n  for Bhsa it is  verse , for Cunei it is  tablet ; exampleSection : an example for the help text\n  for this data source; levels : information about the node types in this\n  data source. search() The work horse of this API.\nExecutes a TF search template, retrieves\nformatted results, retrieves \nformatted results for additional nodes and\nsections. Parameters: query Search template to be executed.\nTypically coming\nfrom the  search pad  in the browser. tuples Tuples of nodes to look up features for.\nTypically coming\nfrom the  node pad  in the browser. sections Sections to look up features for.\nTypically coming\nfrom the  section pad  in the browser. For the Bhsa these are  verse  references,\nfor Cunei these are tablets by  P-number . condensed Whether or not the results should be  condensed .\nNormally, results come as tuples of nodes, and each\ntuple is shown in a corresponding table row in\nplain or pretty display. But you can also  condense  results in container\nobjects. All tuples will be inspected, and the nodes\nof each tuple will be gathered in containers,\nand these containers will be displayed in table rows.\nWhat is lost is the notion of an individual result,\nand what is gained is a better overview of where\nthe parts of the results are. condenseType When condensing results, you can choose the node type\nthat acts as container. Nodes get suppressed Nodes in result tuples that have a type\nthat is bigger than the condenseType, will\nbe skipped.\nE.g. if you have chapter nodes in your results,\nbut you condense to verses, the chapter nodes will \nnot show up.\nBut if you condense to books, they will show up. batch The number of table rows to show on one page\nin the browser. position=1 The position that is central in the browser.\nThe navigation links take this position\nas the focus point, and enable the user\nto navigate to neighbouring results, in ever bigger\nstrides. opened=set() Which results have been expanded and need extended results.\nNormally, only the information to provide a  plain \nrepresentation of a result is being fetched,\nbut for the opened ones information is gathered for\npretty displays. withNodes=False Whether to include the node numbers into the formatted\nresults. linked=1 Which column in the results should be hyperlinked to\nonline representations closest to the objects\nin that column. Counting columns starts at 1. options Additional keyword arguments are passed\nas options to the underlying API. For example, the Cunei API accepts  linenumbers \nand  lineart , which will ask to include line numbers\nand lineart in the formatted results. csvs() This is an other workhorse.\nIt also asks for the things  search()  is asking\nfor, but it does not want formatted results.\nIt will get tabular data of result\nnodes, one for the  sections , one for the  node tuples ,\nand one for the  search results . For every node that occurs in this tabular data,\nfeatures will be looked up.\nAll loaded features will be looked up for those nodes.\nThe result is a big table of nodes and feature values. The parameters are  query ,  tuples ,  sections , condensed ,  condenseType  and have the same meaning as\nin  search()  above.",

We do not care for the moment.\n\n\nThe indexes in this sequence, from 1 till the number of \"words\", are our slots.\nLet's say we have \nS\n of them.\n\n\nWe start constructing a mapping from numbers to node types, called \notype\n.\n\n\nWe assign to numbers 1, ... ,\nS\n the string \nword\n.\n\n\nThat means, we have now \nS\n nodes, all of type \nword\n.\n\n\nStep 2: add higher level nodes\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor each level of \nsection\n, \nsubsection\n and \nparagraph\n, make new nodes. Nodes\nare numbers, and we start making new nodes directly after \nS\n.\n\n\nWe have 4 main sections, so we extend the \notype\n mapping as follows:\n\n\n\n\nS+1\n ~ \nsection\n\n\nS+2\n ~ \nsection\n\n\nS+3\n ~ \nsection\n\n\nS+4\n ~ \nsection\n\n\n\n\nLikewise, we have 11 subsections, so we continue extending:\n\n\n\n\nS+5\n ~ \nsubsection\n\n\nS+6\n ~ \nsubsection\n\n\n...\n\n\nS+16\n ~ \nsubsection\n\n\n\n\nWe do the same for \nparagraph\n.\n\n\nAnd after that, we break the paragraphs up into sentences (split on \n.\n), and we\nadd so many nodes of type \nsentence\n.\n\n\nThe mapping \notype\n is called a \nfeature\n of nodes. Any mapping that assigns\nvalues to nodes, is called a (node-)feature.\n\n\nContainment\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe also have to record which words belong to which nodes. This information takes\nthe shape of a mapping of nodes to sets of nodes. Or, with a slight twist, we\nhave to lists pairs of nodes \n(n, w)\n such that the word \nw\n \"belongs\" to the\nnode \nn\n.\n\n\nThis is in fact a set of edges (pairs of nodes are edges), and a set of edges is\nan \nedge feature\n. In general it is possible to assign values to pairs of nodes,\nbut for our containment information we just assign the empty value to every pair\nwe have in our set.\n\n\nThe edge feature that records the containment of words in nodes, is called\n\noslots\n.\n\n\nStep 3: map nodes to sets of words\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor each of the higher level nodes \nn\n (the ones beyond \nS\n) we have to\nlookup/remember/compute which words \nw\n belong to it, and put that in the\n\noslots\n mapping:\n\n\n\n\nS+1\n ~ { 1, 2, 3, ... x, ..., y }\n\n\nS+2\n ~ { y+1, y+2, ... } ...\n\n\nS+5\n ~ { 1, 2, 3, ... x }\n\n\nS+6\n ~ { x+1, x+2, ...}\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\u00b6\n\n\nNow we have two features, a node feature \notype\n and an edge feature \noslots\n.\nThis is merely the skeleton of our text, the \nwarp\n so to speak. It contains the\ntextual positions, and the information what the meaningful chunks are.\n\n\nNow it is time to weave the information in.\n\n\nStep 4: the actual text\n\u00b6\n\n\nRemember the words with punctuation attached? We can split every word into three\nparts:\n\n\n\n\ntext: the alphabetical characters in between\n\n\nprefix: the non-alphabetical leading characters\n\n\nsuffix: the non-alphabetical trailing characters\n\n\n\n\nWe can make three node features, \nprefix\n, \ntext\n, and \nsuffix\n. Remember that\nnode features are mappings from numbers to values.\n\n\nHere we go:\n\n\n\n\nprefix[1]\n is the prefix of word 1\n\n\nsuffix[1]\n is the suffix of word 1\n\n\ntext[1]\n is the text of word 1\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\nAnd so for all words.\n\n\nStep 5: more features\n\u00b6\n\n\nFor the sections and subsections we can make a feature \nheading\n, in which we\nstore the headings of those sections.\n\n\n\n\nheading[S+1]\n is \nIntroduction\n\n\nheading[S+5]\n is \nBasic concepts\n\n\nheading[S+16]\n is \nIdentity\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\nFor paragraphs we can figure out their sequence number within the subsection,\nand store that in a feature \nnumber\n:\n\n\n\n\nnumber[p]\n is 1 if \np\n is the node corresponding to the first paragraph in a\n    subsection.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want absolute paragraph numbers, you can just add a feature for that:\n\n\n\n\nabs_number[p]\n is 23 if \np\n is the node corresponding to the 23th paragraph\n    in the corpus.\n\n\n\n\nMetadata\n\u00b6\n\n\nYou can supply metadata to all node features and edge features. Metadata must be\ngiven as a dictionary, where the keys are the names of the features in your\ndataset, and the values are themselves key-value pairs, where the values are\njust strings.\n\n\nYou can mention where the source data comes from, who did the conversion, and\nyou can give a description of the intention of this feature and the shape of its\nvalues.\n\n\nLater, when you save the whole dataset as TF, Text-Fabric will insert a\n\ndatecreated\n key-value.\n\n\nYou can also supply metadata for \n''\n (the empty key). These key-values will be\nadded to all other features. Here you can put stuff that pertains to the dataset\nas a whole, such as information about decisions that have been taken.\n\n\nYou should also provide some special metadata to the key \notext\n. This feature\nhas no data, only metadata. It is not a node feature, not an edge feature, but a\n\nconfig\n feature. \notext\n is responsible for sectioning and text representation.\n\n\nIf you specify \notext\n well, the \nT-API\n can make use of it, so that\nyou have convenient, generic functions to get at your sections and to serialize\nyour text in different formats.\n\n\nStep 6: sectioning metadata\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nsectionTypes: 'section,subsection,paragraph'\n\n\nsectionFeatures: 'title,title,number'\n\n\n\n\nThis tells Text-Fabric that node type \nsection\n corresponds to section level 1,\n\nsubsection\n to level 2, and \nparagraph\n to level 3. Moreover, Text-Fabric knows\nthat the heading of sections at level 1 and 2 are in the feature \ntitle\n, and\nthat the heading at level 3 is in the feature \nnumber\n.\n\n\nStep 7: text formats\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nfmt:text-orig-plain: '{prefix}{text}{suffix}'\n\n\nfmt:text-orig-bare: '{text} '\n\n\nfmt:text-orig-angle: ' <{text}> '\n\n\n\n\nHere you have provided a bunch of text representation formats to Text-Fabric.\nThe names of those formats are up to you, and the values as well.\n\n\nIf you have a list of word nodes, say \nws\n, then a user of your corpus can ask\nText-Fabric:\n\n\n1\nT\n.\ntext\n(\nws\n,\n \nfmt\n=\n'text-orig-plain'\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will spit out the full textual representation of those words, including\nthe non-alphabetical stuff in their prefixes and suffixes.\n\n\nThe second format, \ntext-orig-bare\n, will leave prefix and suffix out.\n\n\nAnd if for whatever reason you need to wrap each word in angle brackets, you can\nachieve that with \ntext-orig-angle\n.\n\n\nAs an example of how text formats come in handy, have a look at the text formats\nthat have been designed for Hebrew:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\nfmt:lex-orig-full: '{g_lex_utf8} '\nfmt:lex-orig-plain: '{lex_utf8} '\nfmt:lex-trans-full: '{g_lex} '\nfmt:lex-trans-plain: '{lex0} '\nfmt:text-orig-full: '{qere_utf8/g_word_utf8}{qere_trailer_utf8/trailer_utf8}'\nfmt:text-orig-full-ketiv: '{g_word_utf8}{trailer_utf8}'\nfmt:text-orig-plain: '{g_cons_utf8}{trailer_utf8}'\nfmt:text-trans-full: '{qere/g_word}{qere_trailer/trailer}'\nfmt:text-trans-full-ketiv: '{g_word}{trailer}'\nfmt:text-trans-plain: '{g_cons}{trailer}'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the actual text-formats are not baked in into TF, but are supplied by\nyou, the corpus designer.\n\n\nWriting out TF\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce you have assembled your features and metadata as data structures in memory,\nyou can use \nTF.save()\n to write out your data as a bunch\nof Text-Fabric files.\n\n\nStep 8: invoke TF.save()\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe call to make is\n\n\n1\nTF\n.\nsave\n(\nnodeFeatures\n=\n{},\n \nedgeFeatures\n=\n{},\n \nmetaData\n=\n{},\n \nmodule\n=\nNone\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you supply for \nnodeFeatures\n a dictionary keyed by your node feature\nnames and valued by the feature data of those features.\n\n\nLikewise for the edge features.\n\n\nAnd the metadata you have composed goes into the \nmetaData\n parameter.\n\n\nFinally, the \nmodule\n parameter dictates where on your system the TF-files will\nbe written.\n\n\nFirst time usage\n\u00b6\n\n\nWhen you start using your new dataset in Text-Fabric, you'll notice that there\nis some upfront computation going on. Text-Fabric computes derived data,\nespecially about the relationships between nodes based on the slots they occupy.\nAll that information comes from \noslots\n. The \noslots\n information is very\nterse, and using it directly would result in a hefty performance penalty.\nLikewise, all feature data will be read from the textual \n.tf\n files,\nrepresented in memory as a dictionary, and then that dictionary will be\nserialized and gzipped into a \n.tfx\n file in a hidden directory \n.tf\n. These\n\n.tfx\n files load an order of magnitude faster than the original \n.tf\n files.\nText-Fabric uses the timestamps of the files to determine whether the \n.tfx\n\nfiles are outdated and need to be regenerated again.\n\n\nThis whole machinery is invisible to you, the user, except for the delay at\nfirst time use.\n\n\nEnriching your corpus\n\u00b6\n\n\nMaybe a linguistic friend of yours has a tool to determine the part of speech of\neach word in the text.\n\n\nUsing TF itself it is not that hard to create a new feature \npos\n, that maps\neach word node to the part of speech of that word.\n\n\nSee for example how Cody Kingham\n\nadds\n\nthe notion of linguistic head to the BHSA\ndatasource of the Hebrew Bible.\n\n\nStep 9: add the new feature\n\u00b6\n\n\nOnce you have the feature \npos\n, provide a bit of metadata, and call\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nTF\n.\nsave\n(\n\n  \nnodeFeatures\n=\n{\n'pos'\n:\n \nposData\n},\n\n  \nmetaData\n=\n{\n'pos'\n:\n \nposMetaData\n},\n\n  \nmodule\n=\n'linguistics'\n,\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou get a TF module consisting of one feature \npos.tf\n in the \nlinguistics\n\ndirectory.\n\n\nMaybe you have more linguistic features to add. You do not have to create those\nfeatures alongside the original corpus. It is perfectly possible to leave the\ncorpus alone in its own GitHub repo, and write your new features in another\nrepo.\n\n\nUsers can just obtain the corpus and your linguistic module separately. When\nthey call their Text-Fabric, they can point it to both locations, and\nText-Fabric treats it as one dataset.\n\n\nStep 10: use the new feature\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe call to \nTF=Fabric()\n looks like this\n\n\n1\nTF\n \n=\n \nFabric\n(\nlocations\n=\n[\ncorpusLocation\n,\n \nmoduleLocation\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll feature files found at these locations are loadable in your session.",

            "text": "Introduction\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Social Construction of Reality is a 1966 book about the sociology of\nknowledge by the sociologists Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann.\n\n\nBerger and Luckmann introduced the term \"social construction\" into the social\nsciences and were strongly influenced by the work of Alfred Sch\u00fctz. Their\ncentral concept is that people and groups interacting in a social system create,\nover time, concepts or mental representations of each other's actions, and that\nthese concepts eventually become habituated into reciprocal roles played by the\nactors in relation to each other. When these roles are made available to other\nmembers of society to enter into and play out, the reciprocal interactions are\nsaid to be institutionalized. In the process, meaning is embedded in society.\nKnowledge and people's conceptions (and beliefs) of what reality is become\nembedded in the institutional fabric of society. Reality is therefore said to be\nsocially constructed.\n\n\nIn 1998 the International Sociological Association listed The Social\nConstruction of Reality as the fifth-most important sociological book of the\n20th century\n\n\nBasic concepts\n\u00b6\n\n\nSocial stock of knowledge\n\u00b6\n\n\nEarlier theories (Max Scheler, Karl Mannheim, Werner Stark, Karl Marx, Max\nWeber, etc.) often focused too much on scientific and theoretical knowledge, but\nthis is only a small part of social knowledge, concerning a very limited group.\nCustoms, common interpretations, institutions, shared routines,\nhabitualizations, the who-is-who and who-does-what in social processes and the\ndivision of labor, constitute a much larger part of knowledge in society.\n\n\n\u201c\u2026theoretical knowledge is only a small and by no means the most important part\nof what passed for knowledge in a society\u2026 the primary knowledge about the\ninstitutional order is knowledge\u2026 is the sum total of \u2018what everybody knows\u2019\nabout a social world, an assemblage of maxims, morals, proverbial nuggets of\nwisdom, values and beliefs, myths, and so forth\u201d (p.65)\n\n\nSemantic fields\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe general body of knowledge is socially distributed, and classified in\nsemantic fields. The dynamic distribution and inter dependencies of these\nknowledge sectors provide structure to the social stock of knowledge:\n\n\n\u201cThe social stock of knowledge differentiates reality by degrees of familiarity\u2026\nmy knowledge of my own occupation and its world is very rich and specific, while\nI have only very sketchy knowledge of the occupational worlds of others\u201d (p.43)\n\u201cThe social distribution of knowledge thus begins with the simple fact that I do\nnot know everything known to my fellowmen, and vice versa, and culminates in\nexceedingly complex and esoteric systems of expertise. Knowledge of how the\nsocially available stock of knowledge is distributed, at least in outline, is an\nimportant element of that same stock of knowledge.\u201d (p.46)\n\n\nLanguage and signs\n\u00b6\n\n\nLanguage also plays an important role in the analysis of integration of everyday\nreality. Language links up commonsense knowledge with finite provinces of\nmeaning, thus enabling people, for example, to interpret dreams through\nunderstandings relevant in the daytime. \"Language is capable of transcending the\nreality of everyday life altogether. It can refer to experiences pertaining to\nfinite provinces of meaning, it can span discrete spheres of reality...Language\nsoars into regions that are not only de facto but also a priori unavailable to\neveryday experience.\"p. 40. Regarding the function of language and signs, Berger\nand Luckmann are indebted to George Herbert Mead and other figures in the field\nknown as symbolic interactionism, as acknowledged in their Introduction,\nespecially regarding the possibility of constructing objectivity.\n\n\nSigns and language provide interoperability for the construction of everyday\nreality:\n\n\n\u201cA sign [has the] explicit intention to serve as an index of subjective meanings\n\u2026 Language is capable of becoming the objective repository of vast accumulations\nof meaning and experience, which it can then preserve in time and transmit to\nfollowing generations\u2026 Language also typifies experiences, allowing me to\nsubsume them under broad categories in terms of which they have meaning not only\nto myself but also to my fellowmen\u201d (p.35-39)\n\n\nSocial everyday reality\n\u00b6\n\n\nSocial everyday reality is characterized by Intersubjectivity (which refers to\nthe coexistence of multiple realities in this context)(p. 23-25):\n\n\n\u201cCompared to the reality of everyday life, other realities appear as finite\nprovinces of meaning, enclaves within the paramount reality marked by\ncircumscribed meanings and modes of experience\u201d (p.25)\n\n\nThis is in contrast to other realities, such as dreams, theoretical constructs,\nreligious or mystic beliefs, artistic and imaginary worlds, etc. While\nindividuals may visit other realities (such as watching a film), they are always\nbrought back to everyday reality (once the film ends)(p. 25).\n\n\nSociety as objective reality\n\u00b6\n\n\n\u201c Social order is a human product, or more precisely, an ongoing human\nproduction \u201d Institutionalization[edit] Institutionalization of social processes\ngrows out of the habitualization and customs, gained through mutual observation\nwith subsequent mutual agreement on the \u201cway of doing things\u201d. This reduces\nuncertainty and danger and allows our limited attention span to focus on more\nthings at the same time, while institutionalized routines can be expected to\ncontinue \u201cas previously agreed\u201d:\n\n\n\u201cHabitualization carries with it the important psychological gain that choices\nare narrowed\u2026 the background of habitualized activity opens up a foreground for\ndeliberation and innovation [which demand a higher level of attention]\u2026 The most\nimportant gain is that each [member of society] will be able to predict the\nother\u2019s actions. Concomitantly, the interaction of both becomes predictable\u2026\nMany actions are possible on a low level of attention. Each action of one is no\nlonger a source of astonishment and potential danger to the other\u201c (p.53-57).\n\n\nSocial objective worlds\n\u00b6\n\n\nSocial (or institutional) objective worlds are one consequence of\ninstitutionalization, and are created when institutions are passed on to a new\ngeneration. This creates a reality that is vulnerable to the ideas of a minority\nwhich will then form the basis of social expectations in the future. The\nunderlying reasoning is fully transparent to the creators of an institution, as\nthey can reconstruct the circumstances under which they made agreements; while\nthe second generation inherits it as something \u201cgiven\u201d, \u201cunalterable\u201d and\n\u201cself-evident\u201d and they might not understand the underlying logic.\n\n\n\u201c\u2026a social world [is] a comprehensive and given reality confronting the\nindividual in a manner analogous to the reality of the natural world\u2026 In early\nphases of socialization the child is quite incapable of distinguishing between\nthe objectivity of natural phenomena and the objectivity of the social\nformations\u2026 The objective reality of institutions is not diminished if the\nindividual does not understand their purpose or their mode of operation\u2026 He must\n\u2018go out\u2019 and learn about them, just as he must learn about nature\u2026 (p.59-61)\n\n\nDivision of labor\n\u00b6\n\n\nDivision of labor is another consequence of institutionalization. Institutions\nassign \u201croles\u201d to be performed by various actors, through typification of\nperformances, such as \u201cfather-role\u201d, \u201cteacher-role\u201d, \u201chunter\u201d, \u201ccook\u201d, etc. As\nspecialization increases in number as well as in size and sophistication, a\ncivilization's culture contains more and more sections of knowledge specific to\ngiven roles or tasks, sections which become more and more esoteric to\nnon-specialists. These areas of knowledge do not belong anymore to the common\nsocial world and culture.\n\n\n\u201cA society\u2019s stock of knowledge is structured in terms of what is generally\nrelevant and what is relevant only to specific roles\u2026 the social distribution of\nknowledge entails a dichotomization in terms of general and role-specific\nrelevance\u2026 because of the division of labor, role-specific knowledge will grow\nat a faster rate than generally relevant and accessible knowledge\u2026 The\nincreasing number and complexity of [the resulting] sub universes [of\nspecialized knowledge] make them increasingly inaccessible to outsiders\n(p.77-87)\n\n\nSymbolic universes\n\u00b6\n\n\nSymbolic universes are created to provide legitimation to the created\ninstitutional structure. Symbolic universes are a set of beliefs \u201ceverybody\nknows\u201d that aim at making the institutionalized structure plausible and\nacceptable for the individual\u2014who might otherwise not understand or agree with\nthe underlying logic of the institution. As an ideological system, the symbolic\nuniverse \u201cputs everything in its right place\u201d. It provides explanations for why\nwe do things the way we do. Proverbs, moral maxims, wise sayings, mythology,\nreligions and other theological thought, metaphysical traditions and other value\nsystems are part of the symbolic universe. They are all (more or less\nsophisticated) ways to legitimize established institutions.\n\n\n\u201cThe function of legitimation is to make objectively available and subjectively\nplausible the \u2018first-order\u2019 objections that have been institutionalized\u2026\nProverbs, moral maxims and wise sayings are common on this level\u2026 [as well as]\nexplicit theories\u2026 symbolic processes\u2026 a general theory of the cosmos and a\ngeneral theory of man\u2026 The symbolic universe also orders history. It locates all\ncollective events in a cohesive unity that includes past, present and future.\u201d\n(p. 92-104)\n\n\nUniverse-maintenance\n\u00b6\n\n\nUniverse-maintenance refers to specific procedures undertaken, often by an elite\ngroup, when the symbolic universe does not fulfill its purpose anymore, which is\nto legitimize the institutional structure in place. This happens, for example,\nin generational shifts, or when deviants create an internal movement against\nestablished institutions (e.g. against revolutions), or when a society is\nconfronted with another society with a greatly different history and\ninstitutional structures. In primitive societies this happened through\nmythological systems, later on through theological thought. Today, an extremely\ncomplex set of science has secularized universe-maintenance.\n\n\n\u201cSpecific procedures of universe-maintenance become necessary when the symbolic\nuniverse has become a problem. As long as this is not the case, the symbolic\nuniverse is self-maintaining, that is self-legitimating. An intrinsic problem\npresents itself with the process of transmission of the symbolic universe from\none generation to another\u2026 [additionally] two societies confronting each other\nwith conflicting universes will both develop conceptual machinery designed to\nmaintain their respective universes\u2026 mythology represents the most archaic form\nof universe-maintenance\u2026 theological thought may be distinguished from its\nmythological predecessor simply in terms of its greater degree of theoretical\nsystematization\u2026 Modern science is an extreme step in this development.\n(p.104-116)\n\n\nSociety as subjective reality\n\u00b6\n\n\nSocialization\n\u00b6\n\n\nSocialization is a two-step induction of the individual to participate in the\nsocial institutional structure, meaning in its objective reality.\n\n\n\"The individual\u2026 is not born a member of society. He\u2026 becomes a member of\nsociety. In the life of every individual\u2026 there is a temporal sequence, in the\ncourse of which he is inducted into participation in the social dialectic\"\n(p. 129) \u201cBy \u2018successful socialization\u2019 we mean the establishment of a high\ndegree of symmetry between objective and subjective reality\u201d (p. 163)\n\n\nPrimary Socialization takes place as a child. It is highly charged emotionally\nand is not questioned. Secondary Socialization includes the acquisition of\nrole-specific knowledge, thus taking one\u2019s place in the social division of\nlabor. It is learned through training and specific rituals, and is not\nemotionally charged: \u201cit is necessary to love one\u2019s mother, but not one\u2019s\nteacher\u201d. Training for secondary socialization can be very complex and depends\non the complexity of division of labor in a society. Primary socialization is\nmuch less flexible than secondary socialization. E.g. shame for nudity comes\nfrom primary socialization, adequate dress code depends on secondary: A\nrelatively minor shift in the subjective definition of reality would suffice for\nan individual to take for granted that one may go to the office without a tie. A\nmuch more drastic shift would be necessary to have him go, as a matter of\ncourse, without any clothes at all.\n\n\n\u201cThe child does not internalize the world of his significant others as one of\nmany possible worlds\u2026 It is for this reason that the world internalized in\nprimary socialization is so much more firmly entrenched in consciousness than\nworlds internalized in secondary socialization\u2026. Secondary socialization is the\ninternalization of institutional or institution-based \u2018sub worlds\u2019\u2026 The roles of\nsecondary socialization carry a high degree of anonymity\u2026 The same knowledge\ntaught by one teacher could also be taught by another\u2026 The institutional\ndistribution of tasks between primary and secondary socialization varies with\nthe complexity of the social distribution of knowledge\u201d (p. 129-147)\n\n\nConversation\n\u00b6\n\n\nConversation or verbal communication aims at reality-maintenance of the\nsubjective reality. What seems to be a useless and unnecessary communication of\nredundant banalities is actually a constant mutual reconfirmation of each\nother's internal thoughts, in that it maintains subjective reality.\n\n\n\u201cOne may view the individual\u2019s everyday life in terms of the working away of a\nconversational apparatus that ongoingly maintains, modifies and reconstructs his\nsubjective reality\u2026 [for example] \u2018Well, it\u2019s time for me to get to the\nstation,\u2019 and \u2018Fine, darling, have a good day at the office\u2019 implies an entire\nworld within which these apparently simple propositions make sense\u2026 the exchange\nconfirms the subjective reality of this world\u2026 the great part, if not all, of\neveryday conversation maintains subjective reality\u2026 imagine the effect\u2026of an\nexchange like this: \u2018Well, it\u2019s time for me to get to the station,\u2019 \u2018Fine,\ndarling, don\u2019t forget to take along your gun.\u2019 (p. 147-163)\n\n\nIdentity\n\u00b6\n\n\nIdentity of an individual is subject to a struggle of affiliation to sometimes\nconflicting realities. For example, the reality from primary socialization\n(mother tells child not to steal) can be in contrast with second socialization\n(gang members teach teenager that stealing is cool). Our final social location\nin the institutional structure of society will ultimately also influence our\nbody and organism.\n\n\n\u201c\u2026life-expectancies of lower-class and upper-class [vary] \u2026society determines\nhow long and in what manner the individual organism shall live\u2026 Society also\ndirectly penetrates the organism in its functioning, most importantly in respect\nto sexuality and nutrition. While both sexuality and nutrition are grounded in\nbiological drives\u2026 biological constitution does not tell him where he should\nseek sexual release and what he should eat.\u201d (p. 163-183)",

He\u2026 becomes a member of\nsociety. In the life of every individual\u2026 there is a temporal sequence, in the\ncourse of which he is inducted into participation in the social dialectic\"\n(p. 129) \u201cBy \u2018successful socialization\u2019 we mean the establishment of a high\ndegree of symmetry between objective and subjective reality\u201d (p. 163)  Primary Socialization takes place as a child. It is highly charged emotionally\nand is not questioned. Secondary Socialization includes the acquisition of\nrole-specific knowledge, thus taking one\u2019s place in the social division of\nlabor. It is learned through training and specific rituals, and is not\nemotionally charged: \u201cit is necessary to love one\u2019s mother, but not one\u2019s\nteacher\u201d. Training for secondary socialization can be very complex and depends\non the complexity of division of labor in a society. Primary socialization is\nmuch less flexible than secondary socialization. E.g. shame for nudity comes\nfrom primary socialization, adequate dress code depends on secondary: A\nrelatively minor shift in the subjective definition of reality would suffice for\nan individual to take for granted that one may go to the office without a tie. A\nmuch more drastic shift would be necessary to have him go, as a matter of\ncourse, without any clothes at all.  \u201cThe child does not internalize the world of his significant others as one of\nmany possible worlds\u2026 It is for this reason that the world internalized in\nprimary socialization is so much more firmly entrenched in consciousness than\nworlds internalized in secondary socialization\u2026. Secondary socialization is the\ninternalization of institutional or institution-based \u2018sub worlds\u2019\u2026 The roles of\nsecondary socialization carry a high degree of anonymity\u2026 The same knowledge\ntaught by one teacher could also be taught by another\u2026 The institutional\ndistribution of tasks between primary and secondary socialization varies with\nthe complexity of the social distribution of knowledge\u201d (p. 129-147)",
