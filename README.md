Text-Fabric is a Python3 package for Text plus Annotations.

It provides a data model, a text file format, and a binary format for (ancient) text plus
(linguistic) annotations.

The emphasis of this all is on:

* data processing
* sharing data
* contributing modules

A defining characteristic is that Text-Fabric does not make use of XML or JSON,
but stores text as a bunch of features.
These features are interpreted against a *graph* of nodes and edges, which make up the
abstract fabric of the text.
